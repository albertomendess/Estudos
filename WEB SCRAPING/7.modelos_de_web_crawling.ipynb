      "TITLE: Opening paths to good jobs—Welcoming Eduardo Levy Yeyati back to Brookings\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Economy and Development program is pleased to welcome Eduardo Levy Yeyati back to the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow. Eduardo was previously a nonresident senior fellow with Brookings and has published extensively with us on issues from debt and monetary policy to labor markets and income inequality.\n",
      "This week, Esther Lee Rosen, senior director of communications at Global, sat down with Eduardo to discuss his research agenda and the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther Lee Rosen (ELR): Welcome to the Global Economy and Development team at Brookings! We are thrilled to have you join us.\n",
      "Eduardo Levy Yeyati (ELY): I am delighted to be here, working with such a talented group at these challenging times.\n",
      "ELR: You are now leading Global’s Workforce of the Future initiative, which has focused on issues such as effective economic development planning and the importance of immigrants to the American workforce. What are key issues you will focus on in the coming months?\n",
      "ELY: The initiative, with which I collaborated in the past, has so far successfully focused on local development, reskilling, and the inclusion of immigrants in the U.S., as well as building data-intensive tools for policymakers that are currently being used to guide productive and training strategies in several U.S. states. But we all know how the world is mutating due to demographic, geopolitical, and most notably, technological changes, all of which call for a significant updating and extension of these tools.\n",
      "Take, for example, the implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for the labor market, particularly the need to orient training toward skills that complement rather than compete with AI. This should reshape the way we think about the connection between education and training with jobs, which would in turn call for the redesign of our tools. It also brings huge opportunities. I am convinced AI can significantly help us improve the way we use our data and calibrate our models.\n",
      "Moreover, the Workforce of the Future initiative’s research, which aims at helping men and women in precarious low-productivity, low-wage occupations to find a path to good jobs, should be particularly useful to reduce labor segmentation and inequalities in developing countries in Africa or Latin America where low-skilled, informal workers represent an important share of the labor force. Adapting and extending our tools for the context of these countries should be one of our priorities. Again, AI may have a positive impact as it could benefit relatively unskilled workers—as a recent study shows—helping developing countries to leapfrog on labor productivity.\n",
      "The same is true for learning and employment records, a truly valuable vehicle to reduce information asymmetries in the labor market, which can be substantially enhanced by AI, and may prove especially impactful in dual labor markets in the developing world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ELR: What are the longer-term research agenda and focus you are interested in pursuing?\n",
      "ELY: The intersection of a human-centered AI and the future or work is a fascinating and growing area for policy research, which I have been working on and writing about for the past few years. Frankly, this area is moving so fast that sometimes I cannot keep up with the pace: The upcoming revised edition of my last book on AI and the labor market will probably be almost a completely new book rather than a simple update.\n",
      "The field is vast. The issues I cover range from the economics of AI and its impact on labor and distribution, to incipient AI regulation and its influence on tax and education reform, with the broader goal of increasing preparedness to profit from technological change while avoiding labor market disruptions or the Turing trap: the temptation to use inferior technologies to reduce costs with no gains in productivity.\n",
      "An important and sometimes overlooked aspect of this intersection is the fact that AI, by construction, captures and uses very effectively knowledge that is documented in data, such as numbers, images, and language, while failing to emulate experiential and practical knowledge, which is sometimes as important if not more, as I argued in a recent blog. This paves the way for a fruitful complementarity, if only we adapt our education to focus more on these learning areas.\n",
      "I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this issue. Labor income is the key distribution channel: Until we find another sustainable way to distribute income, we need to preserve it.\n",
      "ELR: How is technology like AI impacting the labor force? What are some opportunities AI provides—and what are its potential risks?\n",
      "ELY: To answer that, bear in mind that technology is still in its exponential phase—in other words, we still don’t know where it will be once it matures. For example, the World Bank in 2016 predicted that developing countries were the most exposed to substitution, whereas a similar study by the IMF in 2024 concluded the opposite. Why? Because we used to think that middle-skilled jobs were first in line, but generative AI is now competing with more sophisticated tasks. Indeed, AI creates a “Robin Hood effect” whereby the most qualified lose against the less qualified, a mixed blessing since this is likely to reduce labor income inequality but also the labor share in output.\n",
      "That said, I already mentioned that generative AI is more complementary than usually thought: To the extent that we adapt to profit from this complementarity, there may be fewer jobs in the future, but they will be better jobs, more productive and lucrative.\n",
      "But we must be cautious. The incipient adoption of AI that we see is barely a preview of things to come once the technology stabilizes and firms approach it not as an accessory but as the foundation of a new way to organize production, which will take longer than technologists predict.\n",
      "Ultimately, though, we need to prepare. There will be fewer jobs, meaning a decline in demand for paid hours, labor shares will likely continue to drift downward, and the jobs that remain, perhaps with the same names, will have a different task composition. I don’t want to sound repetitive, but we need to reevaluate the way we think of education and training, and we need to promote human-centered technologies.\n",
      "On the positive side, the fact that AI does not substitute for experience and judgment may tilt education and jobs toward the aspects of work that are more intrinsically human, if we prepare accordingly, that is. More reason to continue with the work of the Workforce of the Future initiative and on the learning and employment records agenda, which I am convinced will be essential for a smooth transition to a better future.\n",
      "ELR: In your experience, what are some key challenges to labor inclusion and further, how do we prepare the labor force for the present and future?\n",
      "ELY: The challenges depend on the countries. In the developed world, concerns are often associated with the future: the fear that technology may substitute jobs or depress wages; the winner-takes-all nature of many new activities, which may lead to concentrated markets and lower wages; or the rapid change in the competences demanded by the market, which results in a mismatch with workers’ current skills that may foster unemployment or overqualification.\n",
      "In developing economies, to the previous list we add pending assignments from the past: informality, low human capital, and an education system often indifferent to labor inclusion. In other words, policymakers need to bridge the gap between insiders and outsiders while aiming at the moving target of future labor demands, all of which makes active labor market policies tremendously complex.\n",

      "The U.S. dollar has risen moderately in the weeks since Donald Trump won the presidential election, in an almost exact repeat of price action after the 2016 election. The dollar rise reflects primarily expectations for fiscal easing and higher growth and still has room to run, based on how modestly interest differentials have moved compared to 2016. A second, much larger phase of dollar strength is likely to come if the U.S. imposes tariffs on China. The lesson from similar tariffs in 2018 is that China allows the yuan to fall as an almost one-for-one offset to the hit to competitiveness. Such a fall is likely to put severe depreciation pressure on the rest of emerging markets, in addition to pulling down commodity prices. Such a tightening in global financial conditions raises the risk of negative spillback to the U.S., which—from China’s perspective—is probably not unwelcome.\n",

      "In the days following the election, U.S. equities rose very sharply. We compare the rise in the S&P 500 in the days following November 5 to what happened in 2016 (Figure 1). Stocks rose much more sharply than back then, potentially on expectations of deregulation, but—as time passed—the dollar began to outperform (Figure 2), perhaps a sign markets are starting to assign some odds to U.S. tariffs (which could be growth negative—thereby weighing on the S&P 500—but lift the dollar).\n",

      "Interest rate differentials of the U.S. vis-à-vis other advanced economies are one way to benchmark the dollar rise. Now as in 2016, expectations of fiscal easing and higher growth are lifting U.S. interest rates versus elsewhere. We compare the move in the 2y2y (Figure 3) and 5y5y (Figure 4) forward rate differential since November 5 (blue) versus what happened in 2016 (black). So far, markets have only lifted the U.S. rate differential around half of what they did in 2016, which means that this source of dollar strength probably still has more room to run.\n",

      "The impact of tariffs on global markets\n",
      "You can think of the current rise in the dollar—predicated primarily on expectations of fiscal easing—as the first phase of dollar strength after the election. A second, perhaps much larger phase may come if the Trump administration imposes tariffs on China. The 2018 experience is instructive in this regard. Back then, the U.S. tariffed half of all imports from China at a 25% rate for an average tariff rate of 12.5%. The yuan fell around 10% against the dollar around then (Figure 5), in what was an almost one-for-one offset for the hit to competitiveness. An across-the-board 60% tariff could necessitate a much larger fall in the yuan if China wants to protect the market share of its export sector in the U.S. Such a fall could put severe depreciation pressure on the rest of emerging markets and cause commodity prices to fall. This global tightening in financial conditions could then spill back to the U.S. and weigh on the S&P 500, which is what happened during the renminbi devaluation scare in 2015 and 2016 (Figure 6). From China’s perspective, such a spillback might not be entirely unwelcome. After all, the president-elect is often thought to see the S&P 500 as one gauge of his success, so persistent weakness like in 2015/6 could make the incoming administration less enthusiastic about tariffs.\n",

      "Even in the run-up to tariffs—before they are even implemented—there could be adverse fallout for global markets. Currently, Brazil is the largest food exporter to China by a substantial margin (Figure 7). If China decides to try to head off tariffs by buying more agricultural products from the U.S., this could amount to a negative shock for Brazil as it scrambles to place its products elsewhere. The same is true for the European Union where transportation equipment is concerned. The EU is currently by far the largest exporter of motor vehicles, aircraft, trains, and ships to China (Figure 8). This could turn into a liability if China starts ordering more Boeing aircraft instead of Airbus, for example. In short, a second, more pronounced phase of dollar strength may start once the president-elect is in office and the likelihood of tariffs rises.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor's note:\n",
      "This commentary is part of the Africa’s Fourth Industrial Revolution blog series. Read the related book on Africa’s 4IR here. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the prevailing narrative that Africa is falling behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the continent is actually home to half of the world’s mobile money accounts, making it a pioneer in integrating 4IR technology into the financial services industry, according to 4C Group and GSMA. As numerous African-led innovations prove, and as I argue in my book Africa’s Fourth Industrial Revolution, advanced technologies have already provided and continue to offer unprecedented opportunities for the continent to improve business performance and connect millions of unbanked people to financial services.\n",
      "Leapfrogging into the 4IR\n",
      "Despite Africa’s slower rates of internet penetration compared to the rest of the world, it is leading the way in other key areas of digitalization, including in the financial industry, indicating that there may be important leapfrogging opportunities available.\n",
      "Africa is home to more than half of the world’s registered and active mobile money accounts (800 million), and in 2023 sub-Saharan Africa was home to almost three-quarters of the world’s accounts and was the source of 70% of the growth in registered accounts. This uptick is in part due to the successful increase in mobile phone subscriber penetration, which outpaces broadband expansion and reached 43% in 2023, with mobile phones accounting for three-fourths of total online traffic in Africa. Mobile money increased GDP in the region by more than $150 billion between 2012-2022 (3.7%). This has led to a robust fintech sector on the continent with lucrative opportunities for the future—according to McKinsey, fintech is expected to reach $400 billion globally by 2028.\n",
      "A key leapfrogging opportunity lies in digital banking and payments. Approximately 90% of all financial transactions in Africa are conducted using cash and coins. Only 2% of Senegal’s population, for example, used a debit card as of 2022, and reliance on cash remains strong meaning there is great opportunity for these countries to leapfrog directly to digital payments.\n",
      "The impact of advanced technologies\n",
      "To facilitate such leapfrogging, advanced technologies are leading the way, with ample African-led innovations entering the financial services market.\n",
      "AI tools are helping customize financial services, from tracking financial transactions to investments and lending. These tools can help personalize services for customers in Africa and thus bring more people into financial services. The size of Africa’s population and number of interactions with digital financial services gives the continent an edge over other regions, since the high volume of data can help train new and existing algorithms faster, according to Sehrish Alikhan of Finextra.\n",
      "Blockchain, which increases the transparency and security of financial transactions, is helping power cross-border payments and decentralized lending. It also dramatically cuts the costs of digital financial transactions and builds trust, which is critical for African fintech.\n",
      "IoT is also at work in the financial sector. For example, M-KOPA, a Kenyan digital financial services company, has integrated advanced IoT technologies into its digital micropayments service, improving processing speed to 500 payments per minute and reaching 3 million people across the continent. The company uses Microsoft’s AI services to forecast and manage financial risk, allowing it to reach millions of unbanked and underbanked Africans and provide them with loans for purchases such as solar lighting, smartphones, refrigerators, and more.\n",
      "New areas for growth and outlooks\n",
      "African-led companies are also expanding into new areas of financial services, recognizing ripe opportunities to use advanced technologies in novel ways.\n",
      "Regulation technology or “regtech” is the use of advanced technologies to design new regulatory tools and enhance regulatory processes, including using AI to monitor data for regulatory data, using blockchain to track and verify compliance data, and using natural-language processing to help organizations understand regulatory requirements. RegTech is becoming an area of interest on the continent and in Nigeria, for example, is expected to see a 40% increase by 2026. \n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are also increasing in popularity in some parts of the continent. In 2023, Nigeria was ranked #2 in the Global Crypto Adoption List, behind India and ahead of the United States. The continent is even leveraging AI to create a new digital currency—the LUMI A.I. Commemorative Coin. One LUMI is backed by 100kWH of solar energy—equivalent to 4 grains of gold—and has gained increasing legitimacy, especially as digital economy platforms such as Swiffin/HanyPay have started to use it. AI is embedded in the currency’s digital coin, making transactions more efficient and secure through advanced encryption methods and allowing it to be integrated into digital platforms including mobile wallets and online banking systems.\n",
      "Fully digital banks, or neobanks, are also starting to emerge as potential players in the industry. South Africa’s TymeBank made its first monthly profit (a challenging mark for neobanks to reach) in December 2023, according to African Business, signaling that it could become more of a player in the years to come.\n",

      "Challenges and strategies\n",
      "These innovations within the financial services sector are showing local and global investors that advanced technologies will continue to change the game in the African market. Despite impressive progress, challenges remain. Millions remain unbanked across Africa, in particular women, according to Leora Klapper at Brookings, which means significant efforts must be made to ensure full financial inclusion.\n",
      "Although a number of strategies will be required to overcome these challenges, three are of particular importance.\n",
      "First, African countries must provide an agile regulatory environment that both enables innovation and protects citizens. The approach will likely differ in each country based on its unique context. For example, as research from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace explains, Kenya has used a “test and learn” approach which helped M-PESA, Kenya’s successful mobile money service, pilot and scale. Nigeria, in contrast, for the most part follows a “banking-led model,” and the Central Bank of Nigeria has played a leading role in prohibiting and approving mobile network operators from operating within mobile money services.  Zimbabwe, meanwhile, has found success using fintech regulatory sandboxes, which provide companies with an experimental approach to better understand how regulations may affect them. The speed and scale at which advanced technologies are being developed and deployed across industries makes it necessary for African countries to move away from old methods of regulation that are often more reactive than proactive. To do so, countries should look at the experience of their African counterparts and think strategically about how their unique business dynamics and overall context might best be supported by different and more agile forms of regulatory environments.\n",
      "Second, African countries should better integrate advanced technologies to improve regulatory environments. RegTech offers tools for countries to experiment with a new way of thinking about regulation—one that uses a performance-based approach to standardize, automate, and streamline processes. By integrating various regtech applications, from machine-readable code that automates the processing of new regulations to image recognition that verifies identities, African countries can successfully identify their best course of action while continuing to adapt at speed as technology advances in their country. The World Economic Forum suggests asking three questions to better analyze what type of technology solution might be the most suitable for a country or company’s unique situation. These questions are: 1. What frictions exist in the regulatory process? 2. What is the nature of these frictions? 3. What processes could be improved to remove such frictions? These questions can help stakeholders identify entry points into the regtech arena and start the important process of integrating technologies into African regulatory ecosystems.\n",
      "Third, African countries need to build trust through enhanced cybersecurity infrastructure, which will be key to expanding 4IR technologies throughout the financial services sector. Fraud and cyber threats have become increasingly prominent, with the financial services sector being the top sectoral target for cyberattacks in 2022-2023. For example, in South Africa, a data breach of millions of citizens’ social security information led to the creation of fake financial offers. To reduce the potential consequences of such data breaches and other cybercrimes, African governments need to focus on strengthening their cybersecurity infrastructure. To do so, African governments, financial institutions, and companies must work together to allocate resources for building defenses against cyber threats, including encryption tools, threat detection systems, endpoint security solutions, and training for employees and customers. Collaboration and proactive measures will be key to direct investment and regulatory harmonization toward building a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem.\n",
      "Overall, African-led innovation within the financial services industry is catapulting the continent to the forefront of the industry, with important implications for digital inclusion and economic growth on the continent. As African countries continue to innovate, African governments and relevant stakeholders must focus on finding the right regulatory balance, integrating advanced technologies into their regulatory frameworks, and fortifying their cybersecurity infrastructure in order to further solidify their leadership role within the industry.\n",

      "TITLE: A deep dive into the 2024 Latino male electorate\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "Latino males have been the most discussed sub-group of the electorate among many that shifted toward Trump in 2024. Despite making up a relatively small number of voters across key battleground states (including only 6% of eligible voters in Georgia), the majority of the blame for Democrats’ rough performance in 2024 has been directed at Latinos, specifically Latino men. In this post, I dig into the data to provide some perspective on the potential factors that led more Latino men to vote for Trump in 2024 than in the last election.\n",
      "While President-elect Trump increased his support among Latino men this cycle, he did not get the majority of this sub-group in 2024. Support for Trump was highest among Latino men under 40 at 48%, 20% of whom were first time voters in 2024. Trump’s performance was driven by the salience of the economy to Latino men and Trump’s misinformation-fueled campaign that falsely blamed immigrants for the economic challenges many Latino men are facing.\n",
      "Trump’s support among Latino men was highest among Latinos under 40\n",
      "How much did Trump improve on his performance with Latino men relative to 2020? This is an important place to begin this discussion, as there is a rather wide range of estimates of just how well Trump did with this sub-group of the electorate. I put a lot of caution on the National Exit Poll’s estimate of 55% for Trump among Latino men, given that similar to the national preelection polls, it is not designed to capture nuances among sub-groups of the electorate and has been critiqued in the past for its inability to fully capture the Latino vote. Although the majority of Latino men did not vote for Trump, it is clear that Trump significantly improved his performance among Latino men.\n",
      "According to the 2024 American Electorate Voter Poll, a survey I reference throughout the rest of this article, 43% of Latino men supported former President Trump—significantly lower than the estimate from the National Exit Poll but much higher than what Harris and Democrats were hoping for. When we note that 38% of Latino men supported a Republican congressional candidate in the 2022 election, this represents a modest yet significant 5% increase in GOP support over the past two years.\n",
      "The 43% for Trump among Latino men is 11% higher than the 32% of Latinas who voted for Trump based on this poll. This is consistent with the 10% gender gap among Latino voters in 2022, when 28% of Latinas supported a Republican congressional candidate. The comparison of Trump’s support across both gender groups of Latinos to the 2022 election suggests that there was a similar movement among Latinas and Latinos toward the Republican Party over that period.\n",
      "One of the more interesting trends within the data is that this gender difference in the presidential vote among Latinos varied tremendously by age. While there was no gender difference among Latinos who are age 60 or older (62% Harris for both groups), there was a 10% difference among Latinos between the ages of 40 and 59. The most significant gender gap was among young Latino voters, with 48% of Latino men under 40 voting Trump compared to 32% of Latinas within this age group.\n",
      "The difference in support for Trump among Latino men across age groups is striking and adds an important nuance to discussions about what increasing support for Trump among men might mean for the future. There is a steady decrease in Trump support with age, with 48% among Latino men under 40, 40% among Latino men between the ages of 40 and 59, and 37% reported among Latino males who are 60 and over. If the GOP is able to maintain this support among young Latino men as they age, it would be critical for future elections. However, given that one-in-five Latino men in this age group voted for the first time this November, they are far from having a solidified relationship with the Republican Party. This gives Democrats hope that this pivotal subgroup may be open to supporting them in the future.\n",
      "Public policy was the driving force for Latino men, not gender bias or discrimination\n",
      "According to the 2024 American Electorate Voter Poll, the cost of living/inflation, economy/jobs, housing costs, and health care costs were the top four priorities for Latino men in 2024. Furthermore, although a slim majority of Latino men believed that Democrats would be better than Republicans at addressing their top priority, Latino men were 8% more likely than Latinas to believe that Republicans would be best at addressing their top priority.\n",
      "The economy’s importance to Latino men, combined with the perception that Trump and Republicans are better at reducing costs and creating higher-paying jobs, was clearly a key factor in shaping their voting behavior this cycle. However, it is important to put this into context. Nearly a third of construction workers in the country are Latino, a labor force hit hard during COVID-19 closures. Furthermore, we found in our academic research that a third of Latino families lost their business/were in jeopardy of losing their business, with Latino men being more likely to experience economic stress during the pandemic.\n",
      "Many of these men have struggled to recover from these economic hardships and likely remembered these experiences when they cast their ballot this cycle. Although the economy gradually reopened under Biden as vaccines became available, many Latino men who faced financial challenges during the closures may blame the Biden administration and Democrats, partly because states with Democratic governors implemented stricter stay-at-home orders compared to Republican-led states.\n",
      "The other policy issue that had an impact on Latino men’s support of Trump is immigration, as immigration and immigrants were especially connected to the economy during this election cycle. Immigrants have consistently been blamed for economic downturns in the United States across our nation’s history, and the Republican Party effectively employed this tactic—blaming immigrants for challenges facing the country, including access to jobs, low wages, and affordable housing. Recent survey research has found that 74% of Americans were exposed to misinformation that “immigrants are taking jobs and causing an increase in unemployment for people born in the U.S.” Despite extensive research demonstrating that immigration boosts economic growth, linking immigrants and immigration policy to the economic challenges faced by Latino families resonated during this election cycle.\n",
      "Let’s be clear: The overwhelming majority of Latino men oppose mass deportations and other aspects of Trump’s immigration agenda. By wide margins, in fact, Latino male voters support immigration policy that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for some time (74%), as well as allowing Latino citizens and permanent residents to sponsor immediate family members more easily to obtain visas (77%). In short, Latino men do not support Trump’s immigration policy agenda.\n",
      "Some have speculated that Latino men may have moved toward Trump and away from Harris due to gender discrimination. The 2024 American Electorate Voter Poll asked respondents directly how they felt about Harris potentially becoming the first woman elected president. As shown in the figure below, 12% of Latino men cited Harris being the first woman president as a major reason for supporting the Democratic nominee, with an additional 22% identifying it as a contributing factor. In comparison, 6% said this was a major reason for voting for Trump, and 11% indicated it contributed to their opposition to Harris. Overall, Harris’ gender led to a net gain of 17% for Harris among Latino men.\n",

      "Attitudes toward the parties and contact rates\n",
      "President-elect Trump’s support among Latino men is consistent with this sub-group’s views about the Democratic and Republican Parties. When asked to evaluate how much each party cares about the Latino community, a higher percentage of Latino men believe the GOP “cares a great deal” about the Latino community relative to Latinas in the sample (38% compared to 28%). Latino men are also 8% less likely than Latinas to believe that the GOP and Trump are being hostile toward the Latino community (27% compared to 38%). Age is again important, as 20% of Latino men under 40 believe that Trump and the GOP is being hostile towards Latinos, much lower than older Latinos. Latino men between 18 and 39 are also the most likely to believe that the GOP “cares a great deal” about the Latino community (44% compared to only 25% among Latino men 60 and older).\n",
      "Voter perceptions of political parties can be influenced by outreach efforts, such as being contacted to consider registering to vote or participating in elections. Nearly half (45%) of Latino men reported that nobody had contacted them this cycle—not the parties, a candidate, or any other potential mobilization agent. This is important, as a lack of direct outreach can lead to a perception that their voice does not matter. Although Latino men who were contacted reported higher contact from Democrats in 2024 (32% compared to 24%), Republicans improved their outreach to Latino men this cycle, which likely had an impact on their voting behavior.\n",
      "The door remains open for Democrats to bring Latino men back into the tent\n",
      "Driven mostly by economic concerns, Latino men, and particularly young Latino men, were more likely to vote for former President Trump in 2024 than in previous election cycles. This group of voters represents an audience Republicans aim to strengthen connections with, and Trump’s choice of Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as secretary of state is likely a symbolic gesture aligned with the party’s strategy to achieve that goal.\n",
      "Despite these challenges, there are reasons for Democrats to be optimistic about winning back Latino men, as highlighted in this data. Support for Trump is highest among young Latino men, many of whom were voting in a presidential election for the first time. As a result, this group is still shaping their opinions about political parties. Additionally, Latino men under 40 hold generally favorable views of the Democratic Party, with 60% believing that Harris and the Democrats “care a great deal” about the Latino community—a figure just 3% lower than their Latina counterparts in the same age group.\n",
      "Most importantly, Latino men overwhelmingly support progressive policies on a variety of issues. This includes 84% who either support “a woman’s right to abortion and believe it should be legal” or oppose government interference in a woman’s ability to make that decision, even if they personally oppose abortion. In contrast, only 16% believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. Additionally, a strong majority of Latino men back initiatives such as expanding clean energy investments, passing a new voting rights act, and closing tax loopholes while increasing taxes on corporations earning over $1 billion in profit. Latino men do not support Trump’s overall policy agenda. Their mandate for the incoming Trump administration should be understood as specifically focused on creating higher-paying jobs and reducing the cost of goods.\n",
      "Democrats must seek leaders within their party who understand the nuances of sub-groups that did not align with them in this election. Regarding Latino men, Senator-elect Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who significantly outperformed Harris in Arizona, is an excellent candidate to lead these efforts. Gallego has highlighted that Latino men are often socialized to prioritize providing for and protecting their families—values that emphasize the importance of economic and immigration issues to this group. This perspective aligns with research indicating that nearly 60% of Latino men feel pressure to provide for their families, and 40% report pressure to succeed at work. Similarly, Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), who won a tightly contested border district, demonstrated the effectiveness of a balanced immigration policy that included border enforcement. The party that advances policies supporting Latinos in achieving financial stability for their families is likely to secure the lion’s share of their votes in future elections.\n",

      "\n",
      "In late October, President Joe Biden issued an apology for the U.S. Indian Boarding Schools program, a century-long concerted effort by the federal government to destroy Native American culture and assimilate Native children through a network of residential schools. This apology—the first of its kind by a sitting U.S. president—comes in the wake of the Department of the Interior publishing the second and final volume of its Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative investigative report, which quantified the scope of the economic, social, and human impacts of one of the most destructive assimilation policies in American history.  \n",
      "Beyond laying bare the devasting impact of the boarding school program on Native communities and children, the Interior Department report also issued an explicit call for the federal government to pursue policies that help Indigenous communities heal, while raising awareness about the lasting impacts of the boarding schools on Native welfare. However, the report made it clear that well-intentioned policymaking and awareness initiatives will be insufficient in addressing the harms done to Native people. The federal government must also commit itself to investment in Indian Country commensurate with the scale of the trauma, economic harms, and social harms the boarding schools levied onto Native people and communities.  \n",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump set to retake office in January, it is imperative that the steps President Biden and the Interior Department have taken do not wither on the vine. Given the destructive legacy of Trump’s last term for Indian Country—as well as the anti-diversity, assimilation-centric rhetoric he and his proxies expressed on the 2016, 2020, and 2024 campaign trails—it will be essential for congressional, state, philanthropic, and private sector actors to take steps to secure future investment and policy change to promote Native American welfare, prosperity, and self-actualization. \n",
      "This analysis provides a brief overview of the federal Indian boarding school system as well as current federal investments targeting Native American education, and proposes several complementary policy actions for holistically supporting Native individuals and communities. It also outlines some of the ongoing barriers to public awareness about the long-term impacts of federal abuse toward Indian Country, and how the historic and modern lack of public awareness creates barriers to new investment in tribal education and cultural revitalization. \n",
      "What were the federal Indian boarding schools? \n",
      "The boarding schools have their roots in the trust and treaty obligations the U.S. government has to Native American tribes. In exchange for the land cessations that Native nations made to the U.S., the federal government obligated itself to meet certain needs for tribes and Native American people for as long as the United States continued to exist on the land. Among these obligations is meeting the educational needs of Native American children.  \n",
      "However, while the deceptively benign name of “boarding school” may conjure images of bucolic campuses and ivy-covered buildings for most Americans, these institutions were instead designed as tools of assimilation and cultural genocide toward Native nations. This mission was codified in 1819 with the passage of the assimilation-focused Civilization Fund Act, which empowered the executive branch to “in every case where he shall judge improvement in the habits and condition of such Indians practicable…employ capable persons of good moral character” and introduce to any tribe adjoining a frontier settlement the “arts of civilization.” The boarding schools were a key tool for advancing the assimilation mission. In many cases, Native American children were kidnapped from their homes and held as hostages in federal “schools,” where they were forced to take new “white” names, forbidden from speaking Native languages, and prohibited from taking part in any Native cultural practices. \n",
      "The findings of the Interior report are sobering. The report identifies 417 boarding schools across 37 states, as well as an additional 1,025 institutions such as day schools, orphanages, and boarding schools that did not receive government funding, but advanced similarly destructive assimilation efforts. Most disturbingly, the report confirms that at least 973 Native children died while in the custody of these schools, which separated children as young as three years old from their parents and communities and subjected them to rampant physical abuse, sexual abuse, and forced manual labor. None of this should be surprising from a set of institutions whose architect, Richard Henry Pratt, stated his goal was to “kill the Indian in him and save the man.” \n",

      "I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by kicking and scratching wildly. In spite of myself, I was carried downstairs and tied fast in a chair. \n",
      "I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids. Then I lost my spirit. Since the day I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities. People had stared at me. I had been tossed about in the air like a wooden puppet. And now my long hair was shingled like a coward's! In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to comfort me. Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as my own mother used to do; for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder. \n",

      "Nor was the U.S. government unaware of the abuses happening at these schools. As early as 1928, the Meriam Report, published by a team led by Brookings researcher Lewis Meriam, documented the substandard education and living conditions at the boarding schools. However, crucially, the Meriam Report did not call for the closure of the boarding schools, but rather recommended additional funding for them, with the aim of helping them function more effectively. In 1969, the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare published a new analysis, known as the Kennedy Report, condemning the boarding schools and labeling them a “national tragedy.”  \n",
      "Yet despite decades of efforts by both Native and non-Native people to call out the abuses at these schools, they nonetheless continued to operate as tools of assimilation until well into the second half of the 20th century. All told, the U.S. government spent more than $23.3 billion on the boarding school system between 1871 and 1969, according to the Interior Department report. Other sources note the last assimilationist boarding school didn’t close until 1978—the year the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed. Today, there are boarding schools that continue to operate on some tribal reservations; however, they are frequently run by or in partnership with tribes, and don’t share the same explicitly assimilationist mission of those operating in earlier decades. \n",
      "At their peak in 1926, an estimated 83% of all Native American children were enrolled in boarding schools. Today, most Native American people are descendants of boarding school survivors, and many of those survivors are still alive. Indeed, many Native American people who are today in their 60s or older, particularly those who grew up in reservation communities, attended boarding schools. \n",
      "What is the state of Native American education today? \n",
      "While the boarding school era ended in the late 20th century, Native American students continue to face inequalities in educational access and outcomes. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ 2003 report, A Quiet Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet Needs in Indian Country, found that federal spending throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s had been wholly insufficient in meeting the basic needs of tribal communities. Moreover, the report found that because increases in funding for Native-serving programs failed to keep up with inflation, the constant-dollar value for federal investment in Indian Country had actually fallen over time. \n",
      "Despite the report’s findings—and its explicit call for strengthened investments—the Commission’s follow-up report in 2018, Broken Promises, found that “efforts undertaken by the federal government in the past fifteen years [had] resulted in only minor improvements, at best, for the Native population as a whole, and, in some respects, the U.S. Government [had] backslid in its treatment of Native Americans”.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A quiet crisis is occurring in Indian Country. Whether intentional or not, the government is failing to live up to its trust responsibility to Native peoples. The federal government undertook a legal and moral obligation to make up for what had been taken from Native Americans and to ensure their well-being. This obligation is rooted in the history of displacement of entire tribes and the confiscation of natural resources that they depended upon for their livelihood. Perennial government failure to compensate Native Americans and the residual effects of the nation’s long history of mistreatment of Native peoples have increased the need for federal assistance even further. Efforts to bring Native Americans up to the standards of other Americans have failed in part because of a lack of sustained funding. The failure manifests itself in massive and escalating unmet needs in areas documented in this report and numerous others. The disparities in services show evidence of discrimination and denial of equal protection of the laws. \n",

      "While the federal government cannot simply spend its way out of liability for the boarding schools, sustained and scaled investment in tribal communities is necessary for reducing the level of social, physical, and economic harms that the legacy of the schools and other past assimilationist policies such as the allotment of tribal reservations continue to inflict. As of 2024, the federal government’s own accounting of its investment in Native people and tribal communities was approximately $35 billion, including $25 billion in discretionary appropriations (approximately 2% to 3% of the federal government’s total nondefense discretionary budget for FY 2024). While this topline spending number may seem significant, only $2.5 billion of these appropriations is directly funding Native early childhood, K-12, and postsecondary education programs—a level of investment that is clearly insufficient given the ongoing challenges that Native students and communities face, and the scale of the federal government’s total investment in Native boarding schools throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.1\n",

      "While insufficient, the federal government’s current investments into Native American education—as well as tribal community and economic development more broadly—nonetheless provide potential channels for addressing the legacy of the boarding schools. Investing in tribally centered, tribally led systems of education for Native children and college students is one clear example. Indeed, the current landscape of tribally run K-12 schools and institutions of higher education was partially motivated by the Kennedy Report, which—in addition to calling for the end of the boarding schools—called for the federal government to establish an “exemplary school system” with funding for education, language and cultural revitalization, and trauma counseling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, Federal Indian schools have primarily served as agents of coercive assimilation into the dominant culture and to a substantial extent they are still playing that role. They have been chronically underfunded and understaffed and have largely failed to recognize the special needs of their students. Only recently have they been conceptualized as a potential national resource. \n",

      "In the wake of the Kennedy Report, Congress enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), which repudiated the boarding schools by allowing tribes to contract with the federal government to run their own schools and determine their own curricula.  \n",
      "Today, the vast majority of Native American students attend state or locally run public schools. However, approximately 7% of American Indian and Alaska Native youth—primarily in rural reservation communities that aren’t served by public schools—are now enrolled across 185 schools funded by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The BIE’s portfolio includes 129 tribally controlled K-12 schools and 56 BIE-operated K-12 schools, plus two BIE-operated higher education institutions (Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute). In addition, some tribes run their own schools that are independent of the BIE portfolio, but still receive federal funding through agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Native Americans. In addition to the two BIE-operated higher education institutions, there are an additional 33 tribally chartered or majority-Native tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. These institutions administer 90 campuses across 15 states.  \n",

      "These schools not only serve to educate Native children and young adults—they also play an important role in revitalizing tribal language and cultural identity, and are critical in helping Native students break out of generational poverty and improving lifelong physical and mental health outcomes for Native individuals and communities. They often partner directly with Head Start providers in Indian Country to improve the quality and availability of early childhood education for Native children. Likewise, tribal higher education institutions contribute to tribal community and economic development. Like other higher education institutions, faculty at TCUs and other Native-serving organizations conduct research—often leveraging Indigenous methodologies—that contributes to community well-being. In addition, 74% of TCU alumni report working in areas related to Native American communities or tribal lands, making TCUs an important source of workforce development for tribal communities. \n",
      "However, these institutions and the students they serve still face acute challenges. Despite spending more per student than other public schools nationwide, schools in the BIE’s K-12 system have persistently languished due to poor management, insufficient funding, and eroding physical infrastructure. Additional disinvestment by the federal government in domains outside of education—such as health care and housing—has created severe obstacles for Native students that BIE schools are ill-equipped to address. As a result, students at BIE schools perform more than two grade levels behind the national average, and about one-third of a grade level behind nearby non-BIE public schools. Only half of students in the BIE’s K-12 system ultimately graduate from high school.  \n",
      "In higher education, while TCUs have generated profound results for the well-being of individual alumni and communities, they have also been plagued by chronic underfunding. For example, of the nearly $345 million in research funding into land grant institutions, less than $5 million was appropriated specifically for research at TCUs (which Congress designated as land grant institutions in 1994). Despite the fact that the land grant system was originally created in 1862 through the expropriation of Indigenous land, in 2022, TCUs received just 1% of the level of land grant capacity funding on a per-institution basis as land grant institutions that were designated under Congress’ original 1862 law. While TCUs receive an average of $137,000 per institution in land grant capacity funding, non-tribal 1862 land grant institutions received an average of $11.6 million per institution. Additionally, many funding streams that specifically target Native American students are ultimately awarded to non-tribal institutions. For example, in FY 2021, the Congressional Research Service found that 85% of all funding appropriated through the Department of Agriculture’s $5 million New Beginning for Tribal Students program was ultimately awarded to 1862 and 1890 land grant institutions instead of TCUs.  \n",
      "Beyond the federal government’s dedicated annual funding to Native American education, tribal educational entities are also engaging in creative ways to access the historic levels of place-based investment Congress passed since 2021. For example, the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Regional Innovation Engines program awarded Navajo Technical University a $1 million development grant for its Advancing Distributed Manufacturing Innovations program, which seeks to “involve tribal communities in technology transfer and advanced manufacturing.” This grant comes during a period of unprecedented investment in semiconductor fabrication labs in and around the Phoenix region by manufacturers such as TSMC and Intel. Tribal communities and Native-led organizations have also seen an influx in investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan Act, which have provided multiple channels of funding for Native-led workforce training, cluster development, entrepreneurial ecosystem-building, broadband infrastructure, and planning and technical assistance. Investments like these demonstrate the value of asset-based approaches to investment in Indian Country by recognizing the value of Native identity, culture, and community in the development and implementation of tribal-serving programs. \n",
      "The Biden administration enabled these investments by prioritizing tribes and Native-led entities in its program guidance and notices of funding opportunities across major federal place-based programs such as the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Build Back Better Regional Challenge, Recompete Pilot Program, and Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (Tech Hubs), as well as the aforementioned NSF Regional Innovation Engines program. The EDA’s programs explicitly name Indian tribes or consortia of Indian tribes as eligible applicants, and the NSF similarly notes that tribal nations are eligible to submit proposals as the lead organization. The EDA also notes that it may establish a maximum investment rate of up to 100% for Indian tribe projects across its programs, and specifically namechecks TCUs as an eligible higher education institution within the Tech Hubs program. Meanwhile, the NSF notes that proposals that may impact the resources or interests of a federally recognized tribal nation will not be awarded funding without prior written approval from the relevant tribal nation. Each of these provisions has helped create pathways for Native communities and Native educational institutions to access these important sources of place-based funding, and should be maintained and enhanced. \n",
      "Increasing public awareness of Native American history faces growing headwinds \n",
      "Unfortunately, many Americans remain unaware of these recent successes and ongoing challenges. This is in part because most schools in the United States don’t teach any Native American history from after 1900, limiting Native American students’ ability to learn about their own history in school and giving students of all backgrounds the false impression that major events involving Native American people happened centuries ago.  \n",
      "Moreover, the current wave of anti-DEI policies and other efforts to suppress aspects of U.S. history in schools and public discourse threaten recent gains such as the boarding schools report. Examples of these policies include the first Trump administration’s “patriotic education” commission, state efforts to ban so-called “divisive concepts” in educational settings, and proposals such as Project 2025’s plan to cut funding for “woke” schools. Each of these ideas puts emerging efforts to teach Native American history at risk.  \n",
      "Finally, efforts to raise awareness of the boarding schools and their history can provoke backlash. This has been the case in Canada, where a more robust national dialogue around its similar system of “residential schools” sparked a growing residential school denial movement. These trends could emerge in the U.S. For example, as awareness of the federal Indian boarding schools has grown, some commentators have already begun to downplay their seriousness, or even insist they were good for Native American children. As such, it’s essential that policymakers allow our full history to be taught to counter these false and problematic ideas. \n",
      "What additional policy actions are needed? \n",
      "Ensuring that modern education and economic development policies translate into actual benefits for tribes will not only require an increase in the level of investment reaching these communities, but also structural change that centers tribes in curriculum design and operational structure; investments in wraparound services that address the unique crises students in Indian Country face; and efforts to educate the public about historic and present harms in Native American communities.   \n",
      "To that end, beyond documenting the scope and scale of the boarding school system, the Interior Department’s report also outlines a series of policy steps the federal government should take to continue the process of reconciliation and healing from the boarding school era. The report recommends eight actions:  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Acknowledge, apologize, repudiate, and affirm” the federal government’s role in the boarding school system. \n",
      "“Invest in remedies to the present-day impacts of the federal Indian boarding school system,” including funding for individual and community healing; family preservation and reunification; violence prevention; high-quality elementary, secondary, and higher education for Native American students; and the revitalization of Indigenous languages. \n",
      "“Build a national memorial” to acknowledge and commemorate the experiences of tribes and Native American people within the boarding schools. \n",
      "“Identify and repatriate children who never returned from federal Indian boarding schools” to their tribes and families. \n",
      "“Return former federal Indian boarding school sites” to U.S. government or tribal ownership. \n",
      "“Tell the story of federal Indian boarding schools” through academic, government, and tribal channels, with an emphasis on sharing firsthand accounts. \n",
      "“Invest in further research” into the present-day health and economic impacts of the boarding school system, as well as related policies such as child removal, confinement, and forced assimilation. \n",
      "“Advance international relationships” with other nations that have their own histories of Indigenous boarding schools, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government has already taken an important first step by explicitly apologizing for its central role in the boarding school system. It is now essential to act on the other recommendations outlined in the report, which would make significant early progress in remedying the ongoing legacy of harm that the boarding schools have left in many Native communities. Beyond the federal government, other organizations such as the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition and the Native American Rights Fund have put forward policy agendas to help Native communities and the nation as a whole heal from the impacts of the boarding schools. \n",
      "This piece does not aim to replicate the work of those organizations. Rather, what follows is a set of actions that federal, state, and local policymakers can take to complement those efforts by bolstering investment in Native American communities, protecting programs that support Native American students, and increasing our understanding of Native American student well-being. \n",
      "First, policymakers should take steps to ensure that progress made to date isn’t undermined. Given the central role that federal agencies play in educating Native students and supporting tribal economies, it’s critical that Congress prevent the incoming Trump administration from taking some of the destructive steps proposed on the campaign trail, such as abolishing the Department of Education. \n",
      "Likewise, while some states have enacted reparative policies for Native American students (such as tuition waivers, scholarships, and on-campus supports), those policies may now be at risk from recent judicial rulings that have sharply limited race-conscious policy in education, as well as potential Trump administration executive actions. In response, Congress should clarify that tribal citizenship is a political designation, not a racial one, and that actions to support tribal self-governance and economic well-being, inclusive of education policy, are not affected by recent federal court rulings. Such a policy could draw on the 1974 Supreme Court case Morton v. Mancari, which ruled that federal hiring preferences for tribal citizens was based on the federal government’s political relationship with tribes and did not constitute racial discrimination because it was “not even a ‘racial’ preference.” This approach would empower policymakers and educational institutions to safeguard Native American student policies that are based on tribal citizenship. \n",
      "Next, policymakers at all levels must do more to increase awareness of Native American history and remove barriers to teaching it. To do so, Congress should pass an “Indigenous Education for All” law that ensures Native American history, including 20th and 21st century history, is taught at all schools that receive federal funding. Such laws have a strong bipartisan history. In 1999, Montana took the groundbreaking step of passing the first Indian Education for All act, which has been followed by more recent state efforts such as Minnesota’s 2023 Indigenous Education for All act. From there, Congress should provide funding to public elementary and secondary schools—which educate the vast majority of Native American students today—to develop culturally relevant pedagogies for Native American students, deepen relationships with local and regional tribes, and provide opportunities such as Indigenous language learning in school. \n",
      "On the higher education side, Congress should bring TCUs into funding parity with other land grant institutions. Raising TCU land grant capacity funding to $11.6 million per year—to match the funding that 1862 land grant institutions receive—would provide an additional $400 million per year to those institutions. These resources can be complemented by providing greater funding for institutions through the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act. Congress should also develop more robust funding streams for other institutions that serve Native American students, such as Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions. Doing so would help improve institutional capacity, individual economic well-being, and tribal community prosperity. \n",
      "Policymakers should also prioritize improving data about Native American students and giving tribes better access to data on their own citizens. Data on Native American students and individuals currently suffers from a variety of shortcomings. In some cases, unreliable sample sizes in government surveys make drawing statistically significant conclusions about Native populations impossible. In other cases, the data is incomplete. For example, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the federal government’s higher education database, does not disaggregate any information on Native American students who are either Latino or Hispanic or multiracial, who combined account for over 75% of all Native Americans. Nor does it collect any data on student tribal affiliation. These decisions make it impossible for researchers and tribes themselves to get a fuller picture of the successes and challenges for Native American students in higher education. Policymakers should increase funding to improve the presence of Native American people in government surveys, and leverage new guidance from the Office of Management and Budget to improve data collection practices about Native American students in education data. Policymakers can complement these efforts with steps such as funding investments into developing greater in-house data capacity for tribes; working with tribes to develop appropriate systems to make gathering, analyzing, and reporting data more efficient; developing a federal framework to protect tribal data sovereignty; and providing greater funding for digital literacy in tribal communities. \n",
      "To support these efforts, Congress should develop a set of robust, place-based investments into tribes and Native American communities, leveraging educational institutions and tribal educational offices as key economic and community development anchors. As discussed above, existing place-based federal programs—such as the Build Back Better Regional Challenge, Recompete Pilot Program, Tech Hubs, and NSF Regional Innovation Engines—can provide templates for the types of investments that leverage educational institutions’ ability to promote community and economic development in places, as well as the provisions that federal agencies should implement to ensure Native American communities can access those funding streams. In addition to developing a new set of place-based programs for Native American communities, policymakers can take steps to make all place-based programs even more accessible to Indian Country. For example, in future programs, Congress could provide additional funding for agencies to conduct proactive outreach to tribes to inform them about these programs and funding opportunities, as well as provide financial and technical assistance to tribes to defray the costs of applying for and implementing federal programs of this size. Given that tribes and TCUs frequently have fewer available resources than other governmental and higher education institutions, this type of additional proactive investment is needed to ensure Native communities truly have an equal shot at receiving federal funding. Policymakers should also attempt to adhere to principles for investing in Native American communities laid out by organizations such as United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. in their Marshall Plan for Tribal Nations, including favoring formula grants over competitive grants and eliminating statutory restrictions on spending to best enable tribal self-determination. \n",
      "Unfortunately, given the stated priorities of the incoming Trump administration and 119th Congress, extensive federal action in support of Native American students and tribal economies is unlikely. Thus, states, municipalities, and philanthropic organizations should in the coming years explore opportunities to execute some of these recommendations on their own. For example, states could expand the funding they provide to TCUs. While historically states have not funded TCUs, these institutions play an important role in supporting rural higher education as well as economic and workforce development in communities that state public colleges and universities do not serve—giving states a compelling economic reason to provide funding. States could also explore developing state-level funding streams to invest in tribal communities, and partner with tribes to share data these institutions collect on tribal citizenship and Native student education (from early childhood through postsecondary). Philanthropic organizations must also step up their investment in Native communities and Native education. Currently, less than 0.5% of all philanthropic funding goes to Native communities, meaning there is significant opportunity for philanthropy to do more to support Indian Country. Philanthropic funding is particularly critical in a moment such as the current one, when opportunities for federal action may be scarce. \n",

      "Indian education doesn’t need another shallow report… [the Secretary] would do well to find some way to confront the reality of Indian culture, community, and history and devise an educational program to meet this specific challenge. If traditional institutions, programs, and teaching have to be changed, so be it. After five centuries of contact, it does not seem too much to ask non-Indian educators and institutions to come to grips with the reality that is the American Indian. \n",

      "This list of policy items should not be taken as exhaustive. Additional investments are necessary, ranging from developing and recruiting top talent to work in Native-serving educational institutions to expanding child care and pre-K in tribal communities, among many others. An array of Native-led and Native-serving organizations have identified additional policy actions to support Native American students and educational institutions. Organizations such as the National Indian Education Association and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium have identified specific policy needs for students in elementary through higher education. The American Indian College Fund has developed research and policy agendas for TCUs in areas such as long-term sustainability, pathways for student success, and academic quality. Finally, a recently published landscape analysis on Native American higher education from the Aspen Institute recommends a variety of policies and best practices for the federal government, educational institutions, and philanthropy, ranging from improving data quality and supporting data sovereignty to developing more robust education-to-employment pathways and incorporating traditional knowledge into skills training. While the list of policy needs is long, it will take significant and sustained investment to overcome the destructive legacy of a century of government-sponsored boarding schools. \n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "While it’s important that the U.S. government has made historic levels of investment into Indian Country since 2020, it’s clear that additional efforts are needed to invest in Native communities and raise awareness of some of the most critical historical issues that continue to affect Native American people today. \n",
      "So, while the Interior Department’s boarding school report and President Biden’s apology for the federal government’s involvement in the boarding schools have likely stirred up significant trauma and complicated feelings for both Native and non-Native people alike, they come at an important time. By gaining a deeper knowledge of the boarding schools and other policies levied against Native Americans, individuals can more easily understand the lingering health, economic, and other impacts that U.S. government actions have on the survivors of those policies and their descendants. \n",
      "Moving forward, what is needed is not a retreat from our history, but rather new resources to learn from it and respond to its modern effects, with the goal of creating a nation where all students, communities, and cultures can thrive. \n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s evolving demographics have long influenced the outcome of presidential elections, but one subgroup within the electorate—foreign-born or first-generation immigrant voters—has been relatively understudied in the mainstream political sphere. With a diverse mix of ethnic and racial identities, political views, and fast-growing cohorts in critical swing states, migrants have been at the center of a politically divisive debate over immigration. And given their size, they have likely had a unique impact on an unprecedented race that culminated in the reelection of Donald Trump.  \n",
      "Even amidst xenophobic rhetoric and being scapegoated for many of the country’s challenges, certain segments of the migrant base—who have traditionally leaned Democratic—were already  shifting to the right in the lead-up to the election. Consequently, given their electoral power, how they voted may have been instrumental in the final outcome of the race. \n",
      "Immigrants are a diverse, growing, and actively engaged voter base \n",
      "Of the nation’s nearly 46 million total immigrants (about three-fourths of which are U.S. citizens or permanent residents), migrant voters or naturalized citizens, at roughly 24 million, constitute most of the migrant pool and roughly 10% of the total U.S. electorate. Since 1965, when U.S. law expanded voluntary immigration from non-European nations, the migrant cohort has grown significantly. It has increased from about five percent to 13.9% of the U.S. population today and shifted from being predominantly white (80%) and Western to increasingly majority-non-white and less Western. Roughly two-thirds of that growth stems from Latin America and Asia, and to a lesser extent, from other regions including Africa, the Caribbean, North America, and Europe. Stretching across the globe, this rich mosaic of racial and ethnic groups includes Asians, Arabs or Middle Eastern and North Africans (MENA), sub-Saharan Africans, Caribbean groups, Latinos, and white immigrants, and stands in stark contrast to the mostly white, U.S.-born electorate.  \n",

      "At the ballot box, evidence shows that foreign-born voter turnout has typically lagged behind the general electorate, partly due to navigating both the bureaucratic naturalization and voter registration processes. Nonetheless, distinct differences among racial and ethnic subgroups, along with a highly politicized environment, particularly around immigration in recent years, has affected this trend.  \n",
      "Foreign-born Asian and Latino groups vote at higher rates than their U.S.-born ethnic counterparts. Black immigrants vote at similar levels while white immigrants participate at lesser rates compared to U.S.-born whites. Yet, in recent years, the foreign-born population appears to be a much more politically engaged cohort, demonstrating above-average levels of voter enthusiasm with turnout exceeding the general electorate. National-level polling conducted between August 16 and August 28, 2024, prior to the election, showed that roughly 97% of naturalized citizens were “definitely or probably going to vote” in the 2024 election. This is above 2020 election levels, where 86.8% of respondents cast their vote, exceeding the nearly 66% of the total electorate—the highest rate since 1900.  \n",
      "In the wake of the pandemic, restrictive immigration and economic and health concerns in Trump’s first term were likely key factors in an atypical 2020 election. Further, in 2024, where many of the same issues were at the forefront, final calculations of voter turnout are likely to be high. Additionally, while migrant voters constitute a small share nationally, they have sizable clout in competitive battlegrounds. For example, 14% of voters in Nevada, seven percent of voters in Georgia and five percent each in Pennsylvania and Michigan are foreign-born. The start of 2024 saw 7.4 million migrants who were likely eligible to naturalize this year and 3.5 million of them have already done so. Their total size tops the margins of victory in virtually all key swing states in the 2020 election, and projected naturalization rates resemble the prior election cycle. For example, in Georgia, the state’s total of 96,469 new citizens surpassed Biden’s roughly 12,000 margin of victory. Mostly comprising foreign-born Asians and Latinos, immigrant participation in this year’s election was expected to be decisive. \n",

      "Still, the key issues that drove new American citizens to the voting booth are not uniform. Despite between four in 10 to six in 10 expressing no strong affiliation/not being sure with either party, immigrant voters still lean Democratic across almost all ethnic groups, except for white immigrants who are more evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Among those who would certainly vote, the polling found they favored Kamala Harris over Trump (by approximately 55% to 41%), both nationally and with some slight variation across key swing states. Similar to the general electorate, high cost of living/inflation ranked as the top issue with immigration following closely behind. Interestingly, on social values issues, foreign-born migrants are almost twice as likely to hold conservative/very conservative views and still identify as a Democrat compared to the overall population. This is further underscored with religious views—overall, immigrant evangelicals identify less with the Republican Party compared to U.S.-born evangelicals and young individuals (ages 18 to 29) are found to be more religious and conservative on social issues than their U.S.-born counterparts.  \n",
      "Linked fate, the idea that policies or issues that affect one’s broader group also impact individuals, could partly suggest why: 60% of respondents believe that what affects immigrants will “strongly or to some extent” affect their own life. In previous generations, European immigrants in the 19th century who were in a pursuit of a better life, were initially dubbed as non-“white” and encountered fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Similarly, several generations later, this modern wave of largely immigrants of color, also in pursuit of a better life, is navigating a 21st century assimilation into the American mainstream. In the past decade, Muslim travel bans, the dehumanization of African, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American groups, anti-Asian hate crimes, and an even more hardline Trump immigration agenda aimed at legal and illegal immigrants have engulfed the political environment. What’s more, many immigrant voters come from mixed status families where one or more members of the household are undocumented while the rest hold legal status—complicating access to resources such as health care and employment. Ultimately, how migrants continue to navigate their foreign identity and new status in support of a political party varies across ethnic lines.  \n",
      "The policy agenda of the immigrant community  \n",
      "The post-election results on how all immigrant groups voted are still forthcoming, but recent surveys taken just prior to the election and the latest exit polls offer some insights. \n",
      "Based on a YouGov national survey of the top issues for over roughly 43,000 immigrant voters (conducted between October 25 and October 27), the key differences across the main issues—such as the economy, abortion, immigration, education, and crime—were along gender, age, race, and ideological lines. Men were found to prioritize the economy more highly than women, whereas women ranked abortion more highly than men. However, older voters rank immigration and the economy above higher than younger voters. Similarly, conservative voters, who are likely older, were more likely to rank immigration and the economy as important relative to moderate and liberal voters. Nonetheless, across almost all policy issues and subgroups, U.S.-born voters rated these issues with greater importance than their foreign-born counterparts. Still, by contrast, across all demographic groups, migrant voters ranked crime and education as more salient than the U.S. native-born electorate. \n",
      "Along racial and ethnic lines, virtually all migrant voters, regardless of political affiliation, ranked the economy and inflation among their top priorities. However, while the economy and the conflict in Gaza were the two top issues respectively among all Arabs, among Arab American Democrats, the conflict in Gaza was ranked as number one. While most Arabs in the U.S. were born here, about 68% of foreign-born Arabs are citizens.\n",
      "Historically, over the past 15 years, their political support has stood at a two-to-one margin for Democrats. Nevertheless, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and U.S. support for Israel led to a dramatic reversal—with Trump slightly leading Harris, 42% to 41% in polls ahead of the election, compared to Biden’s 59% to 35% edge in 2020. Additionally, even though expected turnout in the MENA community slipped from 80% to 63%, Michigan for example, where Biden won by 154,000 votes, houses its largest base of voters among all swing states—over 300,000. Further, the recent Democratic primary saw more than 100,000 Michigan primary voters choose “uncommitted” in protest against the administration’s handling of the war, and Arab Americans make up almost half of the populations in the cities where Biden lost to the protest vote. Taking all these factors into account, there were growing signs that Democrat support could be splintered between Trump, a third party, and/or by abstaining—and those indications proved true. The city of Dearborn, an Arab American majority city, saw Trump winning (42.4%), Harris (36.2%), and Jill Stein (18.3%)—a remarkable shift from Biden’s 68.8% to Trump’s 29.9% in the 2020 election. Further, this appears to be somewhat reflected in the latest exit polls—Trump won 60% of Michigan voters that identify as “other race” and 54% of the same cohort nationally. \n",
      "Asian Americans as a racial subgroup are majority foreign born (67%), lean Democratic (42%), and contain a large number of Independents (31%), compared to the overall electorate. Partly attributable to the fact that they typically experience less campaign outreach, 27% reported not having been contacted by either political party. As a cohort, according to polling conducted in September, 77% of Asian Americans were likely to vote. Overall, they were expected to support Harris by a 38+ margin—largely along gender lines: 70% of Asian women supported Harris while only 57% of Asian men did. Additionally, while almost all ethnic groups trended in this direction, Hawaiian Natives/Pacific Islanders leaned Republican. However, the actual margin turned out to be considerably smaller (15 points in favor of Harris), according to recent election results. Conversely, Since 2020, Trump has made a five-point gain nationally among Asians and, most notably, carried a majority in Nevada (50% to 47%).  Concerns over inflation, health care, and crime, coupled with diverse political views, were likely key driving factors in the broader shift. With roughly 31% of Asian Americans leaning Independent, Trump made a four-point gain with all Independents—in a race where their turnout exceeded Democrats for the first time and was equal to that of Republicans.  \n",
      "Within the Latino base, where migrant voters comprise 25% (as of 2018), Harris secured a majority of all Latino voters (52% to 46%), However, Trump made significant gains—largely driven by the economic anxieties of Latino men. Notching a 10-point advantage with Latino men (54% to 44%), he overcame a roughly 23-point deficit to Biden just four years prior (59% to 36%). Still, while migrants favored Harris (by a seven-point margin) and also favored a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (by an eight-point margin), compared to the overall Latino electorate, they still appear to hold somewhat similar views to U.S.-born Latinos. Despite having been subjects of anti-immigrant language by Trump, polling finds that a majority of both U.S.-born (67%) and foreign-born Latino voters (51%) do not feel that the president-elect is referring to them. Surprisingly, this reflects a sharp reversal of what one might expect to see regarding immigrant linked fate within the Latino community. Certain subsets appear to be prioritizing partisanship and other policy issues (largely inflation) above racial and identity politics and immigration, and to be favoring a more conservative agenda. This may partly explain Trump’s relative insulation from promoting racially prejudiced epithets, which has led to inroads with certain swaths of the Latino electorate.  \n",
      "What’s more, this is underscored by the variation seen across country of origin. South American and Central American immigrants are roughly twice as likely as Mexican immigrants to identify with the Republican Party. Even so, there was some expectation that the denigration of Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” by a comedian at the closing Trump campaign rally could be an outlier—having seeped from politics into the cultural mainstream. Drawing swift condemnation from within the campaign, across the political aisle, and by a slew of high-profile Latino celebrities, it went beyond denouncing mostly illegal immigrants to disparaging the very core identity and cultural heritage of an entire territory. Yet, instead of a wider spillover effect among Latinos in favor of Harris, support swung the other way in Trump’s direction—helping to secure above or near-even margins in key states, such as Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina.  \n",
      "Among Black and white immigrants, there is somewhat limited nationally representative data on their voter priorities compared to other demographics. However, evidence suggests that Black immigrants, primarily from the African and Caribbean regions, and roughly 10% of the overall Black population, tend to vote for Democrats, similarly to U.S.-born Blacks. However, Black migrants rank the economy and immigration as more important than native-born Blacks and also rank the economy higher than all other migrant and non-migrant groups—suggesting that Black immigrants and more specifically Black immigrant men may be one of the most economically vulnerable of all the cohorts. The trends in the polls to some extent suggest why. Trump’s relative gains with Blacks overall (currently at roughly 13% support) was mostly driven by disaffected Black men—particularly in Midwest states such as Wisconsin, with large swaths of blue-collar workers now supporting him. Seventy eight percent of Black men supported Harris, compared to 80% for Biden in 2020, Further, an analysis of Black male voters shows that while roughly 11% of U.S.-born Black men voted for Trump in 2020, an even higher number of foreign-born Black men (30%) did so. This reveals how differing socio-cultural experiences formed in one’s home country, distinct from the U.S., and coupled with the challenges of assimilating into a foreign country, can influence voter choice.    \n",
      "On the other hand, white immigrant voters (roughly three percent of the total white electorate as of 2018), in contrast to other racial groups, exhibited more of an even split between the two parties. Still, while they rank immigration and abortion higher than all other migrant racial cohorts, they rank the economy/inflation and immigration as significantly less important than would U.S.-born white voters. Based on the latest exit polls, there did not appear to be a significant change in the white electorate compared to the previous 2020 election—white men voted at roughly the same levels of support for Trump with a slight softening of support among white women. \n",
      "Ultimately, given migrants’ diverse political views and electoral sway in this tight race, both the incoming administration and future campaigns will need to take stock of their concerns. With rising interracial marriages and mixed-race subgroups, not only is international migration estimated to outpace U.S.-born population growth by 2060, but the country is also expected to be majority minority by 2045, more closely resembling its foreign-born makeup of voters. While the president-elect did not secure a majority of migrant voters, he was, with a largely national economic message, able to make significant enough gains within a fractured Democratic coalition. Conversely, the Harris campaign struggled to distance itself from the economic issue saddling the Biden administration, and underperformed among the Democratic base.  \n",
      "Still, despite the deep political rift currently dividing the nation, the country is still inextricably linked to one common shared identity—America is a nation of immigrants, with longer-term descendants of past generations and more recent newcomers. And the majority of its inhabitants continue to pursue the American dream—seeking to make a better life for themselves, their families, and their communities. It is therefore incumbent on the next president to work with Republicans and Democrats to unify the country and enact a set of policies that not only caters to the diverse needs and everyday concerns of the immigrant community across the aisle, but also of the entire country at large. It remains to be seen how this will unfold in the coming weeks, months, and years ahead. But what is certain is that as the country’s racial dynamics continue to evolve, new Americans, like their predecessors from past generations, will continue to play a critical role in U.S. politics for years to come.\n",

      "\n",
      "A key objective of the COP29 summit is to finalise the ‘New Collective Quantified Goal’ (NCQG) – a new financial target for supporting developing nations in their climate action. Total global climate finance increased significantly between 2018 and 2022 from all sources, including domestic, international, public and private, from $0.67 trillion to $1.46 trillion. However, it still falls far short of what is required, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs) other than China. Accelerating the global climate finance agenda is therefore essential to ensure that all countries have the financial resources to address the escalating impacts of climate change and drive a just transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient development. \n",
      "In parallel to the NCQG negotiations, a wave of reform agendas has emerged since COP26 to overhaul the global climate (and development) finance landscape outside of the formal COP negotiations. Although these initiatives vary in origin, scope and regional focus, they share one critical oversight: a lack of attention to gender inequality and the transformative potential of climate financing that addresses the differential constraints and opportunities for men and women. This commentary examines this gap, why it matters and how climate finance reform could be re-envisioned.\n",
      "Gender gaps in climate finance reform proposals\n",
      "Since 2021, momentum has grown for reforming the global climate finance system, spurred by the only belatedly met $100 billion goal and escalating climate impacts, along with other crises that have deepened inequalities between advanced economies and EMDCs. In response, high-profile initiatives such as the Bridgetown Initiative, UN SDG Stimulus Plan, V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, African Leaders’ Nairobi Declaration and Paris Pact for People and the Planet (4P) have emerged to create a more inclusive, resilient financial architecture that addresses both climate and development finance (see Box 1).\n",

      "While each initiative offers a unique approach, reform proposals broadly converge on key themes: aligning climate action with development priorities, improving emergency liquidity for climate shocks, addressing debt challenges through improved management and relief, expanding multilateral lending, mobilising private sector finance, scaling up concessional funding, innovating liquidity mechanisms, and enhancing access to climate finance and capacity-building.\n",
      "Some of these initiatives reference gender gaps, but all fall short of tackling them head-on. The SDG Stimulus Plan, for example, briefly references ‘women and girls’ in the context of poverty but fails to highlight the types of approach that could reduce women’s time and income poverty. The Paris Agenda underscores the importance of gender equality in financing, but this commitment is not reflected in actionable strategies. Other frameworks, such as Bridgetown 3.0, the V20 Accra-Marrakesh Agenda and the Nairobi Declaration, make little to no reference to gender gaps or women’s participation, despite aiming to support vulnerable populations. \n",
      "Regardless of whether and to what extent these initiatives specifically take gender equality into account, the solutions they propose may have different consequences for men and women. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Untenable debt and debt servicing obligations reduce the fiscal space for governments to invest not only in climate action, but also in the types of public infrastructure and services on which women tend to rely more than men, increasing their unpaid labour and reducing their earning potential. The initiatives’ focus on debt relief (if done in a way that takes gender dynamics into account) therefore provides an important basis for enhancing women’s equality and participation in the green transition. \n",
      "Women experience greater barriers to accessing private climate finance than men, creating a structural under-investment in women-owned businesses that cannot be rectified by simply making more finance available. Mobilising private finance through dedicated instruments such as gender bonds, different types of insurance instruments and targeted support for women entrepreneurs can play a role in helping to address this imbalance, but any initiative requires the consideration of the systemic barriers that prevent women’s access to private finance.\n",
      "Currently, the large majority of climate finance flows into mitigation efforts as opposed to adaptation. Adaptation finance represents only 6% of emerging market economies’ total climate finance, but accounts for a larger share in the least developed countries at 38%. Mitigation finance is focused on traditionally male-dominated sectors, such as energy and transport, while women-dominated sectors like small-scale agriculture often lack the finance needed for adaptation and investment in clean technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "These examples highlight that without a deliberate focus on the structural drivers of gender inequality, these initiatives risk reinforcing existing inequalities rather than tackling them. By contrast, explicitly targeting gender inequality through climate projects can improve climate outcomes for all and increase the impact of finance dispersed, including by increasing uptake of low-carbon solutions, encouraging economic growth and innovation in new green technologies and improving agricultural productivity.\n",

      "Rethinking priorities for the climate finance agenda\n",
      "Applying a gender lens cannot be an afterthought but must be foregrounded in agenda-setting priorities. We note three gaps to address in current climate finance discussions:\n",
      "1. Care services and infrastructure\n",
      "Care infrastructure has always been fragile due to lack of investment in policies, services and resources to support the care of children, the elderly and others. As a result, care systems have largely depended on women and girls undertaking a disproportionate share of their family and communities’ caregiving responsibilities, through both paid and unpaid labour – but always undervalued. An estimated 16.4 billion hours per day are spent on unpaid care work globally, the equivalent of 2 billion people working full-time without pay or formalised support.\n",
      "Climate change adds stress to this fragile care infrastructure. Climate shocks disrupt and make care work more challenging. This can flare up acutely in cities, where urban infrastructure deficits that manifest in informal settlements and poor access to energy, fuel, clean water or basic social services can make caregiving especially difficult. These problems are increasing as caregivers struggle through more extreme heat and other extreme weather events, and municipalities receive higher rates of rural migrants. Integrating care services and infrastructure into climate finance reform, therefore, is not just about recognising care as a sector but about recognising its foundational role in community resilience and enabling women to participate more fully in climate adaptation and the emerging green economy.\n",
      "2. Agricultural adaptation\n",
      "Increasing finance to transform the agriculture sector is particularly important for food security and the types of activities that women carry out in that sector. In areas across Sub-Saharan Africa with high weather variability and significant dependence on rainfall, women are more likely than men to engage in agriculture in drought-prone areas or areas affected by heat waves. Climate change creates ripple effects throughout food value chains and distribution systems, including losses in the nutrient content of key food crops and increases in foodborne pathogens. Food storage, marketing and transport are challenged more frequently by flooded roads and damaged port infrastructure. Ensuring transformation in agriculture and food security is therefore critical. Targeted financing for sustainable agricultural practices can enhance food security, nutrition and resilience and boost women’s ability to adapt in their central roles in these systems. \n",
      "3. Social safety nets\n",
      "Insufficient social protection is underpinned by women’s unpaid work to keep families healthy, fed and nurtured, and also fails to reach the poorest workers, including female workers in agriculture and informal employment. Shoring up social protection floors in developing countries requires new thinking about how to estimate the costs of adequate and resilient care systems, systems to protect small farmers, universalising cash transfers and embedding the financing estimates in both development and climate finance discussions. Combining social protection with climate change adaptation, for example, can both guard against income loss and promote more resilient livelihoods. Some countries, including the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Kenya, are building anticipatory climate adaptation mechanisms into their routine cash transfer programmes which are activated automatically before extreme weather events to help households cope.\n",
      "Space to do better  \n",
      "That so many proposals to reform international climate finance have come forward, and that so many of them originated from emerging markets and developing countries, is a positive development and opens up much needed space for debate. However, despite growing recognition that gender equality and climate finance are interlinked, this recognition is missing in recent reform proposals. Moving forward, these and similar initiatives should integrate issues critical for gender equality – including care, agriculture and climate adaptation –  and ensure that voices advocating for these issues heard and respected. This is about more than setting quantitative targets. Reforms of the global climate finance architecture, new finance goals like the NCQG, and revisions of countries’ action plans expressed in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), must embody a deep commitment to the quality of finance delivered– and integrating gender equality is central to rethinking how and where finance is allocated and distributed.\n",

      "TITLE: The resurgence and impacts of teacher strikes\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1981, President Reagan’s decision to fire striking air traffic controllers seemed to mark the death knell for labor actions in the United States. Union membership has plummeted by over 60% since 1970, and worker participation in strikes has seen an even more dramatic 90% drop. For decades, strikes have seemed to be like vinyl records—relics of the past. Perhaps they evoke a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, romanticized and somewhat symbolic for those who remember them fondly, but they have been perceived as ineffective tools in the modern landscape.\n",
      "Yet, like the vinyl record, recent years have seen a surprising resurgence in teacher strikes. From Wisconsin in 2011 to the nationwide “RedForEd” movement in 2018, educators have taken to the picket lines with renewed vigor, seeming to garner public support and win significant concessions. This unexpected revival prompted my colleagues Matthew Kraft (Brown University), Matthew Steinberg (Accelerate), and me to investigate the prevalence, causes, and impacts of teacher strikes in the 21st century.\n",
      "Uncovering data\n",
      "Our first challenge was a lack of comprehensive data. Since 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has only collected data on strikes involving 1,000 or more employees. This means they are missing a lot of teacher strikes, as 97% of school districts employ fewer than 1,000 teachers. To fill this gap, we created a novel dataset by systematically searching for and reviewing approximately 90,000 news articles, a process that we validated with administrative data from two states. This painstaking process allowed us to document 772 U.S. teacher strikes from 2007 to 2023, providing the most comprehensive dataset on teacher strikes in recent history.\n",
      "The landscape of modern teacher strikes\n",
      "Our research reveals a complex landscape of teacher strikes across the United States. Figure 1 visualizes the distribution of strikes geographically. We count any public school district that had to cancel at least one day of school as a separate striking district. This means we include legal, illegal, coordinated, and individual strikes, as well as “wildcat” strikes, “walk-outs,” or “sick-outs” that lead to school closures. When strikes are coordinated across districts, we conceptualize those as multiple strikes based on the number of districts cancelling classes.\n",

      "The impact of these actions has been substantial, affecting roughly 11.5 million students and leading to the cancellation of 3,403 school days (or 48 million student days) over 16 years. Nationally, the median number of strikes per year is 12.5, resulting in an average of 89 days of canceled school annually. Most strikes are brief, with 65% ending in five days or less and a median duration of two days. The longest strike lasted 34.5 days.\n",
      "Surprisingly, 75% of the strikes we identified occurred in states where teacher strikes are illegal. This reflects the old labor maxim, “there is no such thing as an illegal strike, only an unsuccessful one.”\n",
      "Why do strikes occur?\n",
      "Understanding why teachers strike is crucial to grasping the broader implications of these actions. From our search process, we tracked the reported reasons for strikes from 2007 to 2023. Teacher compensation emerged as the primary driver, cited in 89% of strikes. This encompasses both salaries and benefits, reflecting ongoing concerns about educator pay across the country. Working conditions were another significant factor, mentioned in 59% of strikes. This category includes issues such as class sizes and general school expenditures (48%), non-instructional staff (16%), and labor rights (10%).  Interestingly, 10% of strikes, particularly those occurring in 2018 or later, included “common good” demands, such as addressing housing or immigration issues. This trend suggests a broadening of teacher unions’ advocacy beyond traditional workplace concerns, positioning educators as advocates for wider community issues.\n",
      "The political and economic impacts of teacher strikes\n",
      "With teachers, and likely other public sector workers, strikes are more than just a negotiation tool in a dual-actor collective bargaining process. In the first peer-reviewed paper to come from this research, Matthew Kraft and I conceptualize teacher strikes as something fundamentally different from private sector strikes. In addition to their use in collective bargaining negotiations, strikes also serve as public signals in a contested policy arena, communicating to both the public and political leaders the need for educational change.\n",
      "To test this idea, we look at both the political and economic effects of teacher strikes. Using a “difference-in-differences” approach that accounts for the non-random timing and location of strikes, we estimate the causal effect of teacher strikes by comparing trends in striking districts to what we would have expected based on trends in non-striking districts.\n",
      "What we find is striking (pardon the pun): Teacher strikes lead to a 130% increase in education-focused political advertising, resulting in education ads representing 11% of all campaign ads in the area where the strike occurred. Effects are largest in the period closest to an election, when ads matter the most. Effects are also larger for the first strike in a given area—subsequent strikes in the same district seem to provide weaker signals to political leaders.\n",
      "Further, in a separate working paper with collaborators Leslie Finger (University of North Texas) and Hyesang Noh (University at Albany), we find that strikes don’t just affect campaigns, they reverberate into election outcomes. Teacher strikes reduce voter turnout among Republicans and decrease the Republican vote share in subsequent general elections in surrounding areas.\n",
      "These political effects also translate into tangible economic outcomes. In a new NBER working paper, we show that teacher strikes have real impacts on educators and classrooms. As illustrated in Figure 2, strikes increase annual teacher compensation by about $10,000 (inflation-adjusted to 2018 dollars, or roughly eight percent of the average teacher’s earnings), an effect that is sustained over time. Working conditions see improvements too, with class sizes decreasing by half a student on average, and expenditures on non-instructional staff compensation increasing by about seven percent. Importantly, they do this via new revenues (e.g. via increased taxes) and expenditures, not reallocations of existing funds. Strikes lead to ~$1,000 per pupil increases, increases that are sustained at least eight years post-strike.\n",

      "We also look at how strikes affect student achievement. Notably, research on teacher strikes in other countries has found negative effects, but that research focuses on strikes that lasted much longer than the typical U.S. strike. We find that U.S. strikes do not affect student achievement in the five years following a strike, though long-term effects remain uncertain.\n",
      "Shorter vs. longer strikes\n",
      "There are some notable differences between shorter and longer teacher strikes. Prior literature from outside the U.S. has found that very long strikes negatively affect students, with research from Canada finding that strikes lasting 10 days or longer lead to small, negative effects on student test scores. Nine out of 10 strikes in the U.S. last fewer than 10 days.\n",
      "When we examine differences in effects between these longer strikes and strikes that last fewer than 10 days, we find that they lead to similar increases in teacher compensation and working conditions. However, longer strikes cause small (three percent to five percent of a standard deviation) declines in student achievement in the year of the strike and the subsequent year. Two years after the strike, the negative effects dissipate. These results are consistent with prior research and align with realities on the ground where strikes of less than two weeks might reasonably be made up at the end of the year or during school breaks.\n",
      "The broader political effects also vary by strike length in important ways. We find that shorter strikes (five days or less) are the most efficacious at capturing the attention of political leaders. In contrast, strikes lasting more than five days have the largest negative effects on Republican turnout and vote share.\n",
      "Taken together, this suggests that both short and long strikes are effective at achieving wins for teachers. The short strikes seem to accomplish this by providing powerful signals to political leaders, whereas the longer strikes accomplish this in a more traditional industrial relations process of holding out until management concedes (potentially at the expense of students).\n",
      "Implications for education, labor, and upcoming elections\n",
      " For teachers and their unions, this work comes at a critical moment for the teaching profession, which is facing historically low levels of prestige, interest, preparation, and satisfaction. Strikes and other labor actions are also on the rise, partly driven by teachers. Our research emphasizes the importance of the credibility of the signaling mechanism of strikes. Teacher strikes have tended to happen only when the situation is dire, making them a trustworthy signal of serious problems. Organizing a strike, like producing and listening to vinyl records, requires more time and effort compared to quicker, more convenient alternatives. This is part of what makes them both rare and powerful.\n",
      "The implications of this body of research extend beyond education policy. For the labor movement as a whole, this research emphasizes that collective action remains a potent force for change, even in an era of union decline. Specifically, our work highlights the effectiveness of coordinating actions across multiple workplaces or regions; for example, coordinated teacher strikes took place in more conservative areas where strikes were more likely to be illegal but nevertheless were able to make similar gains as individual district strikes. We also emphasize the importance of leveraging public opinion and political pressure alongside traditional bargaining tactics. Importantly, teachers have achieved wins through relatively short strikes that minimize harm to students. Workers may benefit from similar strategies, especially if they frame demands in terms that resonate with other workers and the wider community.\n",
      "As we make sense of the recent elections, this research can also help consider the impacts of recent protests over wages, the use of automation and AI, and international conflicts. Some may not think of strikes as protests, but like all forms of protest, strikes are “a mode of political action oriented toward objection to one or more policies or conditions, characterized by showmanship or display of an unconventional nature, and undertaken to obtain rewards from political or economic systems while working within the systems.” This research, together with previous studies, suggest protest effects on election outcomes likely depend on: the level of disruption, presence of violence, duration of the action, and crucially, its location. In a tight race, the impact of protests in battleground areas (like North Carolina or Pennsylvania) could tip the electoral balance.\n",
      "Just as vinyl records have again become relevant, strikes have reemerged in the spotlight. Both possess a unique resonance that modern technological alternatives struggle to replicate. However, the delicate balance is key—overplay a record, and it loses its magic; overuse strikes, and they risk becoming background static. In the end, the trick will be figuring out how workers can judiciously use strikes as a tool to resist oppression in an unequal American political economy.\n",

Meanwhile, a growing stream of scholarship has shown that certain groups—including women and many workers of color—remain underrepresented in technology-oriented fields, despite the importance of diverse workforces for firm, industry, and national competitiveness.\n",
      "This new analysis finds that far from being unnecessary overreach, proactive policies aimed at reducing disparities by race and gender are still needed to support the well-being of the digital economy.\n",
      "This report contributes to the literature on inclusion in digital technologies by exploring which workers have access to “highly digital” jobs—namely, those that make the most intensive use of digital technologies. It focuses on a subgroup of highly digital occupations: computer, engineering, and management (CEM) occupations, which play unique roles in the digital economy.\n",
      "Computer and engineering jobs are central to the creation and dissemination of the products and processes that enable the digital economy. In this regard, these occupations aren’t just highly digital themselves—they also build the technologies that make other occupations highly digital.\n",
      "Management occupations, meanwhile, help shape the direction of hiring and advancement for firms and industries. Among other responsibilities, management occupations play a unique role in determining the demographics of highly digital occupations: who has access to the opportunities these jobs provide, and who doesn’t.\n",
      "In short, highly digital CEM occupations play a central role in enabling the future direction of the digital economy.\n",
      "However, today, CEM jobs remain highly unequal across gender, race, and place, with little progress over time in remedying these inequalities. As the report and below interactive demonstrate, the supply of highly digital CEM jobs varies significantly by place. However, women as well as Black, Latino or Hispanic, and Indigenous workers remain underrepresented in every metropolitan area in the nation.\n",

      "This analysis comes at a critical time. In recent years, federal policymakers have begun working to reverse demographic and geographic economic divides through a set of historic investments contained in major federal laws. Yet for all of that, emerging political and legal efforts are seeking to eliminate policies aimed at supporting the progress of historically underrepresented racial groups, and the election of Donald Trump is likely to accelerate the rollback of such policies on the federal level. This means that just as new initiatives have moved to address demographic and geographic divides, the emerging federal policy landscape threatens to block efforts to help workers find opportunities in CEM or other highly digital workplaces.\n",
      "These crosscurrents could prevent workers from accessing the best-paying, most technology-oriented occupations. In this regard, this report provides six key data-oriented findings about highly digital CEM jobs, and identifies three important barriers to improving demographic and geographic inclusion in highly digital CEM work. From there, it proposes a series of robust state and local policy recommendations to build out the pathways to such opportunity, as well as needed federal supports.\n",
      "As the report concludes, only through sustained investment over time and an enthusiastic embrace of new approaches by all stakeholders—including those in the private sector as well as state, local, and federal actors—will the nation be able to build a stronger, more equitable, and ultimately more competitive digital economy.\n",

      "TITLE: Cut the government with a scalpel, not an axe\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trump administration should be congratulated for making government efficiency a high priority. Absolutely no one, liberal or conservative, wants to see their tax dollars wasted. But cutting government is a tricky business for two reasons. The first, outlined in a companion piece here by John Dilulio, is that the vast majority of the government’s work is not conducted by civil servants paid by the federal government—it is conducted by contractors who spend tax dollars. Any honest look at efficiency would have to take a look at contractors as well as the federal workers. The second is that if the Trump administration were to be successful in actually cutting as deeply as they are suggesting, the disruption would be intolerable to nearly every American regardless of party.\n",
      "People like to say they want less government spending but hate it when their favorite program is cut. Conservatives want defense spending to be maintained or even increased. Senior citizens don’t want anyone to touch Social Security or Medicare. Most want law enforcement and health programs to promote their well-being. Nearly everyone wants clean water, reliable power grids, and strong border security.\n",
      "“Disruption” is a favorite word in the business community, where it sometimes results in innovation, ingenious products, and great profits. But no one has to buy a particular car or frequent a special e-commerce site. The problem is that in contrast to the private sector, many of the things government does are not optional. They are required to serve the public and maintain vital services already approved by federal officials. Thus “disruption” in government can mean that Congress won’t approve the reductions and the “government disruptor” will be thrown out at the next election by voters upset at the proposed reductions.\n",
      "So, let’s see how government cuts might work in the Trump administration. Trump has chosen Vivek Ramaswamy along with Elon Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. So far, they’ve said they want to cut $2 trillion from the federal government, dissolve agencies, and reduce the workforce by draconian amounts.\n",
      "The biggest portion of federal spending is mandatory spending—money that goes directly back to the citizen; this includes Social Security, (the largest), Medicare and Medicaid, veteran benefits, and unemployment insurance. Who gets these benefits and how much they get them is set in law. The DOGE team could chalk up a lot of savings by cutting Social Security benefits, but they would have to go to Congress to change the law first. No executive can unilaterally  impose spending reductions on programs already approved by Congress. Indeed, Trump himself, who made one of the wisest political decisions ever when he promised not to touch people’s Social Security or Medicare, would probably be the first politician in line to throw the DOGE team out if they want to cut Social Security.\n",
      "Assuming that you can’t cut mandatory spending (which is 66% of the 2022 budget), the DOGE team will have to look for savings in what’s known as discretionary spending. After paying interest on the debt, that amounts to about 26% of overall federal spending. In 2023, this category was $1.7 trillion, much of which is traditional defense spending. There is not enough money in the discretionary pot to meet Ramaswamy’s goal in one year; over two years, the cuts would be almost impossible.\n",
      "Here are some examples of what’s in the discretionary part of the budget and how deep cuts would affect it. Let’s suppose that to meet these goals, the DOGE team planned to cut 80% of the workforce. Here’s what would happen:\n",
      "There are about 1,800 air traffic controllers right now. These are highly skilled workers who keep planes from crashing into one another on the runway or in the air. Cutting air traffic controllers by 80% would mean we’d be left with 360 people to manage American air space. Perhaps artificial intelligence could someday replace these people but right now that seems as unsafe as self-driving cars.\n",
      "There are about 19,357 border patrol agents working to protect American borders right now. An 80% cut would leave just under 4,000 agents protecting our borders. It’s hard enough to hire border patrol agents as it is, so a cut that big will truly open the borders and make a complete mockery of Trump’s pledge to be tough on illegal border crossings.\n",
      "Over at the Social Security Administration, 60,000 people are responsible for approving checks totaling over $1.5 trillion per year. They approve benefits for people who are newly retiring, take people off the rolls as they die, correct mistakes, search for fraud, and do many other jobs to keep the money flowing to those who earned it. An 80% cut would leave 12,000 people to administer a program that represents 30% of income for people over age 65 and considerably more for poorer people.\n",
      "Other “bloated bureaucracies” that come under the discretionary portion of the budget are the people at the Centers for Disease Control that track down foodborne illnesses each year. The FBI has come under extreme criticism ever since they took documents from Mar-a-Lago. But if it was abolished, who would track down and prosecute the drug cartels that bring fentanyl and other drugs that are destroying America into the country? And who would supply weather forecasts, including hurricane and tornado warnings if the employees at the National Oceanic and Space Administration were cut?\n",
      "So how do you cut government? With a scalpel, not an axe. I know because between 1993 and 2000, the Clinton administration ran a program called the National Performance Review, which I directed under Vice President Al Gore. Nicknamed REGO for “reinventing government,” the program became the longest-running reform effort in American history—resulting in 426,000 cuts to the federal workforce. We conducted a thorough review agency by agency, something the DOGE program would be wise to repeat. That resulted in hundreds of recommendations, two-thirds of which were enacted with $136 billion in savings. We enacted customer service standards and performance metrics (under the Government Performance and Results Act passed in 1993). We closed superfluous offices, cut 16,000 pages of regulations, passed a major procurement reform bill, and fixed longstanding challenges in agencies from FEMA to the FAA.\n",
      "But that was thirty years ago. It’s time to do it again. Things that were just pipe dreams back then, like filing taxes electronically, are now standard operating procedures. When we started the National Performance Review, the internet was just becoming available to Americans; by moving government information and then transactions online, we saved a lot of money. No doubt today’s technology can save even more.\n",
      "But so far, the unrealistic approach DOGE has taken has in it the seeds of its own failure, both from a policy and political standpoint. Americans won’t like it if the border becomes more open or if airplane safety is dramatically imperiled. And don’t mess with Social Security checks. A screwup there will create such a blowback that it will have Trump running his efficiency experts out of the White House faster than you can say “Department of Government Efficiency.”\n",

      "This Policy Brief is based on an article entitled “Efficient and Equitable Income Taxation of the Affluent,” published in Tax Notes, November 18, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax policy discussions regarding the wealthy typically focus on how much affluent households should pay relative to other households. For example, President Biden stated, “Let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share” in his 2022 State of the Union address. Similarly, criticism of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) often centers on how it disproportionately reduced taxes for high-income households.\n",
      "These arguments agree that the wealthy should pay more in taxes, but the current debate has focused less on how to structure the taxation of high-income households. The structure of taxes is important because while typical American households primarily earn income in the form of wages and salaries, affluent households typically receive a much greater share of their income in the form of returns to capital. As a result, the taxation of these households can have a meaningful impact on neutrality and efficiency of the overall tax code.\n",
      "The taxation of the wealthy can create distortions which can influence numerous taxpayer choices and thus affect economic efficiency and horizontal equity. Although changes to the tax system over the past several decades have greatly reduced these economic distortions, there is still room for improvement. Fundamental tax reform could further reduce or eliminate these distortions.\n",
      "How the affluent earn their income\n",
      "In general, households can earn both labor and capital income. Labor income includes wages, salaries, and fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are payments to, or on behalf of, workers in lieu of cash and can include health insurance, transportation, entertainment, and club memberships. Further, employers make several payments on behalf of workers, such as contributions to government social programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Capital income is the return a household receives from assets, and it can come in several forms. Households may earn interest income, rents, royalties, corporate dividends, capital gains, pass-through business profits, and returns to pensions.\n",
      "In the aggregate, most income earned by households in the United States is labor compensation. In 2023, about 69% of net factor income was labor compensation (either wages, salaries, or fringe benefits).1 Various forms of capital income constitute the remaining 31%. The largest components of capital income are corporate profits (13.4% of national income) and proprietor’s income (9% of national income). The remaining capital income comes from net interest and imputed rental income from homeowner-occupied housing (8% of national income).\n",
      "Most Americans receive almost all their income through wages and retirement income (pensions, section 401(k) plans, Social Security, and IRAs) (Figure 1). The most recent available IRS data (2014) show that wages and retirement income made up 93% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution. Even for households in the 98th to 99th income percentile, wages and retirement income accounted for 71% of AGI.\n",

The individual income tax features a graduated rate structure that, after allowing for the standard or itemized deductions, features tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%. The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance tax collects 12.4% of wages up to $168,600 (a cap that is adjusted annually for changes in average wages). The Medicare hospital insurance tax collects 2.9% of wages and salaries, without limit. Each tax is split equally between employer and employee.\n",
      "Filers with modified AGI above $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) also face an “additional Medicare tax” of 0.9% of wages, salaries, and self-employment income. Some fringe benefits (for example, health insurance) are exempt from taxation or face deferred taxation (for example, contributions to section 401(k) plans). Other fringe benefits are taxed as ordinary income (for example, gym memberships, bonuses, and employer-provided vehicles).\n",
      "Capital income \n",
      "Tax rules for capital income are more complex than those for labor income. As with labor income, some forms of capital income face multiple taxes, some are taxed at ordinary rates, and some are partially or wholly exempt.\n",
      "Corporate profits face the corporate income tax, a flat 21% entity-level tax. After-tax corporate profits that are distributed to shareholders as dividends are either taxed as qualified income at a rate up to 20% or as ordinary income at a rate up to 37%. Retained earnings that result in appreciated corporate stock held for less than a year (short-term gains) are taxed as ordinary income (like wages and salaries) at a statutory rate of up to 37% or, if held for more than a year are treated as qualified income and taxed at a rate of 20%.\n",
      "Individual also earn passthrough business income—profits reported on individual tax returns from sole proprietorships, S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies—which is taxed as ordinary income and faces statutory tax rates of up to 37%. Some passthrough business profits can qualify for section 199A, the 20% deduction for qualified business income. The top marginal tax rate for income qualifying for the section 199A deduction is 29.6% (80% of the 37% top statutory rate).\n",
      "Net business income of sole proprietors also faces tax under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA), which mirrors the payroll taxes on wages and salaries. The SECA tax is 15.3% of certain business income on the first $168,000 of net income and 2.9% on income over that threshold. The 0.9% additional Medicare tax also applies to this income.\n",
      "Dividends and realized capital gains, as well as certain pass-through business income earned by high-income individuals, also face the net investment income tax, a 3.8% tax that applies to taxpayers with modified AGI above $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n",
      "Other capital income including net interest received, rents, and royalties is generally taxed as ordinary income, although in some cases rents and royalties can qualify for section 199A. All three forms of income are subject to net investment income (NII) tax.\n",
      "How the tax code distorts decision making \n",
      "Given the various types of income earned by high-income households, the differences in how this income is taxed has implications for both the neutrality and efficiency of the tax code. For example, taxing capital income at higher rates would increase the progressivity of the tax system by raising the tax burden on high-income households. However, this could also change the relative tax treatment of capital and labor income or other types of capital income in ways that encourage tax avoidance behavior and could distort real economic decision making.\n",
      "There are numerous ways the current tax code influences taxpayer behavior, but over the past decade, lawmakers, policy analysts, and academics have focused on a handful of important margins: Whether to take income in taxable form, how to classify taxable income, which organizational form to adopt, which asset to invest in, how to finance investment, and when to realize gains. Although each of these decisions has distinct impacts on an individual’s tax liability, the magnitude of each of these distortions varies under current law.\n",
      "Whether to take income in taxable form\n",
      "When tax rates change, taxpayers adjust their behavior, often with the goal of minimizing or reducing their tax burden by either reducing taxable forms of income such as wages and capital income or increasing deductions. For affluent households, the top marginal rate on taxable income influences the decision to report an additional dollar of taxable income by affecting the net-of-tax return on an additional dollar of income. For example, under current law the top statutory tax rate is 37%, meaning that the net-of-tax rate is 0.63. Restoring the top tax rate to 39.6% would reduce the net-of-tax rate by 3.65% to 0.604. At a -0.25 elasticity, this would imply that taxable income would fall by nearly 1% for taxpayers subject to the top tax rate.\n",

      "In general, the top statutory tax rate on ordinary income has declined over time, reducing the incentive to shield taxable income from taxation (Figure 2). In 1960, the top statutory tax rate on ordinary income was 91%. This declined to 70% after the 1964 tax cuts and to 50% after the 1981 tax cuts. The last significant reduction in the top statutory tax rate was included in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced the top statutory tax rate to 28%. The top rate was then increased multiple times in the 1990s, first to 31% in 1991 and then to 39.6% in 1993. Since then, the top rate has varied only slightly. It was temporarily cut from 39.6% to, eventually, 35% as part of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 before reverting to 39.6% in 2013. Most recently, the top rate was cut to 37%, but it is scheduled to again revert to 39.6% in 2026.\n",
      "How to classify taxable income\n",
      "Most affluent Americans are owners of, or significant investors in, closely held businesses. Using administrative tax data from 2014, Matthew Smith et al. show that more than 69% of the top 1% of earners (and more than 84% of the top 0.1%) have at least some income from passthrough businesses. Owners of closely held businesses have substantial latitude to classify their compensation as either wage or capital income for tax purposes. Meanwhile, investors are often able to select a role as active or passive investors, while corporations can decide to remit profits to owners through either dividends or share repurchases. As a result, differences in how these varying forms of income are taxed have important implications for how the wealthy report their business income.\n",
      "The incentive to report income as one form or another is driven by differences in the top statutory tax rate on reported income.\n",
      "In the case of certain pass-through businesses, this distortion is significant: Wages face a tax rate 10.6 percentage points higher than business profits (Table 1). The large gap is the result of two existing policies: section 199A, which reduces the top statutory income tax rate on these profits from 37% to 29.6%, and gaps in SECA and the NII tax, which do not apply to these profits. Other passthrough businesses do not face this sort of incentive. Owners of general partnerships and sole proprietorships generally do not split their compensation between labor and capital returns. All income is taxed as self-employment income, which is treated roughly the same as labor compensation.\n",

      "The incentive to report income as profits rather than wages is much smaller for owners of closely held C corporations. Corporate profits face a similar top marginal tax rate as labor compensation. All in, C corporation profits are taxed at 39.8%, which is the combined burden of the corporate income tax and the individual income tax on dividends (including the 3.8% NII tax). This is only 0.4 percentage points lower than the top marginal tax rate on labor compensation.\n",
      "For C corporations, there has been a long-standing tax advantage to returning profits to their shareholders in the form of stock buybacks rather than dividends. Although dividends and stock buybacks face the same top statutory tax rate of 23.8%, an advantage exists for buybacks because a portion of the return is not immediately taxed as it is in the case of a dividend.\n",
      "Which organization form to adopt\n",
      "Under current law, there are two major legal forms of businesses: C corporations and passthrough businesses—the latter including sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations. Passthrough businesses account for the vast majority of businesses and a majority of total business profits. Passthrough entities do not pay tax at the entity level. Rather, their owners or partners report their shares of profits on their individual income tax returns. Taxpayers choose the legal form of their business based on the relative costs and benefits of each legal form (for example, in terms of the legal liability an entity protects against, the ability to borrow funds, and tax liability).\n",
      "Under current law, the tax code places a lighter tax burden on passthrough businesses than on C corporations. Table 2 compares the average effective tax rate (ETR) by major legal form of organization. The average ETR is a forward-looking ETR that measures the share of pretax profits subject to tax. This measure includes the effect of statutory tax rates on returns net of any deductions or credits a business expects to receive. Under current law, C corporations, on average, face a 6.6 percentage point higher average ETR than passthrough businesses (36.1% versus 29.5%), when individual-level taxes on corporate payouts are included in the effective corporate rate.\n",

      "Table 3 compares the tax wedge on six major types of assets. The tax wedge measures the difference between the pretax return and the after-tax return on new investment. Under current law, intellectual property faces the lowest tax burden (a tax wedge of -0.1 percentage points). This is because a major component of IP products—research and development—is eligible for the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit. Equipment and software face a tax wedge of 0.5 percentage points. Equipment and software’s tax wedge is lower than that of other assets because they often qualify for bonus depreciation, which reduces the effective tax burden on these assets relative to other depreciation regimes. In contrast, nonresidential and tenant-occupied residential structures, which do not generally benefit from accelerated depreciation, face tax wedges of 0.9 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. Finally, inventories and land face the highest tax burdens (tax wedge of 1.4 percentage points each) because the cost of these assets cannot be deducted until they are sold.\n",

      "Businesses finance new investment by issuing new equity shares to investors, using retained earnings, or borrowing funds. Without tax considerations, businesses would balance debt and equity financing, equalizing the marginal cost of each source. Under current law, there is a clear tax benefit to using debt financing over equity financing to fund business activities. This encourages companies to use more debt than they would in the absence of taxation. Businesses must balance this benefit with the nontax costs of debt, such as financial distress costs, debt overhang, and personal income tax rates for investors holding debt.\n",

      "Under current law, the tax wedge on debt-financed investment is 0.6 percentage points, which is 0.2 percentage points lower than the tax wedge of 0.8 percentage points on equity-financed investment (Table 4). The bias in favor of debt-financed investment is primarily the result of taxing debt financing once, while taxing equity investment twice. The bias is partially offset by limitations on net interest expense that were enacted as part of the TCJA and the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains.\n",
      "When to realize gains\n",
      "The current tax system relies in part on a realization principle. For administrative convenience (and perhaps liquidity reasons), taxpayers are often taxed only when they realize income. For example, capital gains and losses are counted only when a taxpayer disposes of an asset. As a result, taxpayers have an incentive to delay selling an appreciated asset and to accelerate the sale of a depreciated asset to realize a loss.\n",
      "For example, consider an asset valued at $100 today. At a real rate of return of 5% and 2% inflation, this asset would appreciate to $107.25 if held for one year and continuously compounded. If the asset is sold at that point, the tax would be $1.73 (rounded up), assuming the taxpayer faced the top statutory tax rate of 23.8%. The after-tax value would be $105.53 (rounded up), and the real average annual after-tax rate of return would be 3.4%. But if the same taxpayer held the asset for 10 years, the asset would grow to $201.38. When sold, it would face a tax of $24.13 for a total after-tax value of $177.25. This return would yield an average 3.7% after-tax return—an average return of 0.3 percentage points higher than if the asset were sold after one year, even though the market rate of return, rate of inflation, and tax rate did not change over the period.\n",
      "How tax reform can enhance neutrality and efficiency\n",
      "Ideally, tax reform would limit or eliminate these and other distortions. Fundamental reforms can differ significantly in both their base (for example income or consumption) and their structure (flat rate or progressive rate). Some of these choices impact how and the extent to which a reform addresses these distortions. To demonstrate, we examine three canonical reforms—Treasury’s broad-based comprehensive income tax (CIT), the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, and Edward D. Kleinbard’s business enterprise income tax (BEIT).\n",
      "The CIT would apply to all sources of income and tax that income at progressive rates. Labor income from wages, salaries, fringe benefits, and retirement income would be taxed. For capital income, the tax base would include all business income, interest, dividends, rents, accrued (as opposed to just realized) capital gains, and the imputed rent from owner-occupied housing. Deductions would be allowed only to ensure income is taxed in the hands of those who ultimately consume it. Passthrough businesses would maintain flow-through treatment. C corporations would continue to face a separate entity-level tax, which would be integrated with the individual income tax. Businesses would depreciate fixed assets in line with economic depreciation, and interest expenses would be fully deductible.\n",
      "Hall and Rabushka propose a so-called flat tax, which is a two-part value-added tax (VAT). Wages and pension income would be taxed at the individual level, above an exemption amount. Besides the family exemption, there would be no deductions or credits for households. The nonwage portion of value-added—cash flow—would be taxed at the entity level. Both taxes would have the same statutory tax rate.\n",
      "Kleinbard’s BEIT would replace the current tax system with a split rate tax system. All businesses would face a flat entity-level tax. Taxable business income would be calculated roughly the same way as under current law with two exceptions. First, interest expenses would no longer be deductible. Second, businesses would receive what is called a cost of capital allowance (COCA). This allowance would be equal to a set percentage of the adjusted basis of assets each year. The provisions would effectively exempt a deemed normal return to assets from the entity-level tax. At the individual level, labor compensation would face a progressive tax, while capital income would face a flat tax at the same statutory tax rate as the business tax. The capital income tax would not be based on capital income received. Rather, individuals would face tax on a deemed normal return to their assets which would match the COCA provided to business entities. Unlike current law, there would be no tax on capital gains when realized. For purposes of our analysis, we assume no individual deductions or credits.\n",

      "Despite underlying differences in the structure of these reforms, all three of these reforms would generally address three of the six distortions: which organizational form to adopt, which asset to invest in, and how to finance a new investment. Although they differ in the extent to which they tax the returns to capital, they do so uniformly, regardless of the characteristics of the underlying investment. The CIT would tax all returns to investment uniformly at the statutory tax rate.2 The BEIT would tax the returns to capital in the hands of savers at the statutory tax rate but exempt them in the hands of business entities. The flat tax would exempt all capital from taxation. As a result, all investments under each reform would face the same tax burden.\n",
      "All three reforms have the potential to limit the incentive to reduce taxable income, but the CIT would have the smallest impact. Of the three reforms, the flat tax would reduce incentives for avoidance the most by lowering the top statutory tax rate, thereby greatly limiting the tax benefit of shielding taxable income. At the flat tax’s originally proposed statutory tax rate of 19%, for example, the net-of-tax rate would rise from 0.63 to 0.81 or by 28.6%. Further, the flat tax would have no personal deductions, eliminating the ability to use them to reduce taxable income. Although the BEIT maintains a progressive individual income tax rate structure, it would still reduce the incentive to decrease taxable income because, as discussed above, we assume it would eliminate all personal deductions. The CIT would maintain more opportunities for taxpayers to reduce taxable income by maintaining a progressive rate structure as well as a handful of deductions.\n",
      "While the flat tax and the CIT would tax all forms of reported income at the same statutory tax rate, the BEIT would maintain meaningful differences between the top marginal tax rates on capital and labor income. All capital income would face a flat tax rate while labor income would be taxed at progressive rates, some of which exceed the capital income tax rate. As a result, this proposal would expand the incentive that exists under current law to report labor income as capital income. For example, a taxpayer who faces a top tax rate of 40% on wages and a capital tax rate of 25% could save 15 cents per dollar of earnings reported as capital income instead of as wages. The BEIT, like current law, deals with this issue with a somewhat arbitrary rule that requires capital returns far exceeding a deemed normal return to be reported as labor income.\n",
      "All three reforms would also reduce the tax differential between dividends and stock buybacks. Under the CIT, all capital income faces the same statutory tax rate, including dividends and capital gains. Further, capital gains are taxed as they accrue, eliminating the deferral benefit for shareholders of companies that buy back their shares. The flat tax would eliminate this tax differential in the opposite way: Capital income would no longer face any individual income tax. As a result, the tax consequences of returning profits in the form of dividends or buybacks are the same: no tax. The BEIT would similarly eliminate the tax differential between dividends and stock buybacks by eliminating taxes on these transactions. As described above, individual capital income is not taxed. Rather, individuals are taxed on an imputed return on their assets each year. Thus, the tax burden on corporate equity is fixed, regardless of how cash is returned to shareholders.\n",
      "BEIT would also reduce the benefits of deferral slightly less than the CIT and flat tax. Under the CIT, capital assets would be taxed as they appreciate. Thus, the ETR on capital assets would be equal to the taxpayer’s statutory tax rate, regardless of the holding period. Elimination of the lock-in effect under the CIT requires taxing assets mark-to-market or using a similar structure. Under the flat tax, the ETR would be zero at the margin and invariant regarding the holding period. The BEIT would also reduce the lock-in effect. As described above, the BEIT would not tax capital gains when realized. Instead, it would impute the normal return on business assets to taxpayers each year and tax those assets at a flat tax statutory tax rate. Thus, taxes would not depend on realizing a gain. Further, any unrealized appreciation at death is taxed. Kleinbard notes that although realized gains do not face immediate tax, the proceeds do face tax if reinvested and increase a taxpayer’s basis in capital assets, and that could discourage sale. The BEIT (and potentially the CIT) would also require special rules for gains attributed to the returns to entrepreneurship. Those rules could discourage firms from going public.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Tax policies affecting the affluent have important consequences for the equity and efficiency of the tax system. We have focused on six tax-related decisions that affluent households often face: whether to take income in taxable or nontaxable forms, how to classify taxable income, which organizational form to adopt, which assets to purchase, how to finance investment, and when to realize capital gains.\n",
      "All six of the issues we have identified can be addressed to a large extent with either income or consumption tax reforms. However, progressive individual income tax rate structures can cause some problems by creating labor/capital arbitrage opportunities for closely held businesses, ownership distortions for businesses, and distortions in debt financing if owners and lenders have different tax rates. Thus, while the tax system has come a long way, removing or reducing the six distortions we have identified will require further reform.\n",

      "TITLE: Artificial intelligence, international security, and the risk of war\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) will affect human society in countless ways, including in the realm of international security. However, I would like to focus on one specific matter: the possibility that AI may increase the risks of war breaking out. Specifically, I would like to offer a caution or warning to leaders in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, and everywhere around the world, in fact.\n",
      "The caution that I offer is based on my reading of history. Specifically, wars often occur when the aggressor develops a theory of rapid and relatively easy victory. Often, such a theory is based in part on a new technology or set of technologies that the aggressor has developed and incorporated into its armed forces as well as its war plans. Believing it has acquired such a capability sooner than its adversary, the aggressor then attacks with an expectation of an easy victory. That could happen in the future with AI. Since AI can accelerate the pace of war, as well as attacks on command-and-control systems, it may be particularly prone to this danger; it could, for example, offer the perception of a possible path to quick decapitation of adversary leadership.\n",
      "Take for example World War I. Benefiting from a marvelous railroad system and a world-class industrial base that had pumped out lots of weaponry, Germany became overconfident. Its infamous Schlieffen Plan for rapidly defeating France, then repurposing forces to fight Russia, was the result of this overconfidence. Political and military leaders convinced themselves that they had figured out a formula for rapid conquest of the enemy. Four years and 10 million fatalities later, Germany lost the war—and its country nearly collapsed.\n",
      "Of course, some wars start without any expectation of quick success on the part of the initiator. Some causes are just and worth the sacrifice. Some pathological leaders like Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany in the 1930s are willing to fight hard and long because they lack ethics, compassion, and decency. But after his success with the blitzkrieg against France, even Hitler developed an unrealistic expectation of rapid success before attacking the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 (that’s why he sent German troops deep into Russia without winter coats). By that point in World War II, he had developed such pride in German technology and martial prowess that he thought he could defeat virtually anyone.\n",
      "Hitler wasn’t the only one who was wrong about the possibility of rapid conquest during World War II. Theorists of airpower like the Italian Giulio Douhet and the American Billy Mitchell believed that strategic bombing (with conventional or nuclear weapons) would quickly terrorize a population into submission. That did not happen when Germany bombed Britain in “the blitz” or when the United States and its allies bombed first Germany and then Japan.\n",
      "Or consider the Korean War. First, the North Koreans were overconfident, and then so were the Americans. Maybe then the Chinese were too; I’m not sure. And it happened again in Vietnam, where the United States expected its high-technology edge, with helicopter mobility and strategic bombardment, to defeat the Viet Cong. We were wrong.\n",
      "The same kind of thing happened again when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein: the Bush administration hoped that “shock and awe” from precision strike technologies foreshadowed a “cakewalk.” There did not occur, of course—even if the first part of the war, overthrowing Saddam, went fast.\n",
      "Vladimir Putin made a similar mistake when invading Ukraine in 2022—perhaps based on the false expectation that it would go almost as easily as his clever seizure of Crimea with quickness, boldness, and “little green men” in 2014.\n",
      "Yes, rapid victories do sometimes happen. But often they don’t—and then it’s too late to undo the war or pretend it never happened. Usually, in such cases, the resulting wars wind up dragging on for a long time. The great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu may have been right to argue that winning without fighting, or with only minimal fighting, is the best kind of victory. But most nations are not able to achieve such happy outcomes in war.\n",
      "We need to remind ourselves that some partial advantage in AI in the future—whoever may believe they attain it—will not make future war easy or rapid victory predictable. That is not usually the nature of war.\n",

      "Eight decades of American foreign aid has generated confusion among U.S. taxpayers on how and how many tax dollars are spent on foreign assistance.\n",
      "As we are in the midst of an election cycle, it is important that candidates, voters, and media have a better understanding of how taxpayer dollars are currently used to advance our national interest.\n",
      "What is foreign aid?\n",
      "Foreign assistance falls into one of three basic categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "Humanitarian assistance (food, medical care, shelter, security) for life-saving relief from natural and manmade disasters.\n",
      "Development assistance that promotes the economic, social, and political development of countries and communities.\n",
      "Security funding that helps strengthen the military, police, and other security forces of a country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relative proportions vary each year. The 2022 budget of $70 billion was representative of the split, with humanitarian assistance accounting for approximately one-quarter, development assistance for almost two-thirds, and security assistance less than one-fifth.\n",
      "Very little assistance is delivered as cash to governments, a recent exception being support for the government of Ukraine (the use of which is checked and rechecked) in response to the Russian invasion. Most funds for humanitarian and development assistance are provided through U.S., global, and local organizations and businesses.\n",
      "How much of US gross domestic product (GDP) is devoted to foreign aid?\n",
      "Historically, as demonstrated by the chart below, foreign aid peaked at 3% of U.S. GDP during the Marshall Plan program to resuscitate Europe following the end of World War II. Subsequently, it ranged from 1% to just less than 0.5% during much of the Cold War. In recent decades, it has hovered in the range of less than 0.33% of U.S. GDP.\n",
      "In terms of the federal budget obligations, foreign assistance accounts for about 1%. In fiscal year 2022, foreign assistance totaled $58 billion and in fiscal year 2023 about $63 billion (final figure not available).\n",

      "Does the US do its fair share?\n",
      "YES & NO. The U.S. is both generous and penurious—it provides more official government assistance than any other country, but considerably less as a portion of our national income. There is a broad international commitment (to which the U.S. has never pledged) that wealthy countries should annually provide 0.7% of GDP to assist developing countries. For 2023, five countries—Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark—met or exceeded that benchmark. The average for all wealthy nations is around 0.3%, with the U.S. ranking at the bottom.\n",
      "As to giving by the American people, the most recent (2020) compilation of all U.S. private (individuals and institutions) contributions to overseas causes totaled $49.3 billion; the level of official U.S. foreign assistance expenditures for that year was $47 billion.\n",
      "Which US government agencies are responsible for foreign assistance?\n",
      "The U.S. foreign assistance structure is complex with more than 20 U.S. government agencies have a role in providing foreign assistance. The most recent data (2022) shows the principal agency for foreign assistance, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), responsible for some 60% of foreign assistance, followed by the Department of State at nearly 30%, the Department of the Treasury at 5%, the Department of Health and Human Services at 3%, and the Departments of Defense and Agriculture and the Millennium Challenge Corporation each under 1%. \n",
      "Does foreign aid go to corrupt, wasteful governments?\n",
      "NO. It can be difficult to identify with precision who implements all of assistance. A sizeable portion of U.S. assistance is passed from one U.S. government agency to another for further subsequent allocation to other implementing entities. When the money does eventually leave the U.S. government, the graph below shows that only a small fraction goes directly to other governments. In the period 2015-2022, just less than 20% went to nonprofit organizations, a little over 10% to the private sector, and less than 20% to multilateral organizations. While the U.S. provides assistance directly to only a few governments, recipient countries—and therefore government—indirectly benefit from the services and support provided to local communities and organizations.\n",
      "Typically, when the U.S. wants to support communities and people and bolster reform in a country that is ruled by a corrupt, uncooperative government, U.S. assistance goes through private channels—NGOs, community groups, businesses, universities, other private entities—or international and multilateral organizations. Accountability of U.S. economic assistance is high—the U.S. imposes stringent, some would say onerous, reporting and accounting requirements on recipients of U.S. assistance, and the General Accounting Office and agency inspector generals investigate possible misuse.\n",

      "Does foreign aid go to autocratic governments?\n",
      "LESS SO TODAY. During the Cold War struggle to stem the spread of communism, when foreign aid was often based on the premise that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” no matter what the nature of the government, aid did find its way to autocratic governments. That substantially changed in the 1990s following the demise of the Soviet Union. However, there are countries that are at best “semi-democratic” and with autocratic elements but where U.S. assistance ends up. This assistance goes mostly through civil society organizations for humanitarian reasons or because of strong U.S. security interests in their stability and that of neighboring countries. However, there is reason to worry that less concern with autocracy may reappear with the abiding anxiety over terrorism and conflict in our post-9/11 era and in a world increasingly dominated by geopolitical considerations, highlighted by concerns over anti-Western and anti-rule-of-law attitudes and actions by countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\n",
      "Does foreign aid produce concrete results?\n",
      "YES. The U.S. government requires regular monitoring and reporting on how and whether assistance programs are working, and periodic evaluations of results. There is evidence that development and humanitarian programs produce considerable results, but less so for programs driven by foreign policy and security purposes. While foreign assistance is by no means the only driver of human progress, which rests primarily in the hands of the government and people of each country, it does contribute in specific areas and to the overall environment supporting human advancement and has chalked up notable successes.\n",

      "BOTH. Foreign aid typically aims to support economic, social, and political development and security of recipient countries and their people. At the same time, such assistance also advances one or all of the following overriding U.S. interests:\n",
      "\n",
      "Contributing to U.S. national security by supporting allies in promoting regional and global stability and peace and addressing transnational threats such as pandemics, trade in narcotics, and non-state malign actors.\n",

      "YES. While the term “foreign aid” is not universally popular and polling reveals that some feel our foreign policy is overextended and would prefer the money be spent to fix our own problems, Americans support U.S. active engagement in the world.

      "BIPARTISAN. This may seem surprising given recent political divisiveness.\n",
      "Over the past 50 years a majority of Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—have supported U.S. active engagement in world affairs. Up until the past decade, Republicans were somewhat more supportive than Democrats and Independents. But, as shown in the chart below, since 2016 the positions of those who identify as Democrats and Republicans have flipped, with Democratic support increasing and Republican support declining (see chart below from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs).\n",

      "But looking at foreign assistance, historically, Democratic policymakers (administrations and Congress) have been more supportive than Republicans policymakers. Take the Truman administration, which initiated the Marshall Plan. Or, in the 1990s, when votes in Congress on foreign aid spending were close, appropriations bills garnered more Democratic than Republican votes. Yet every president, Democratic and Republican, apart from Donald Trump, has been a strong proponent of foreign aid.\n",
      "In fact, some of the most rapid increases in foreign aid have come during Republican presidencies. For instance, despite George W. Bush being a skeptic of foreign aid before entering the White House, the budget for foreign assistance double from $16 billion in 2001 to $33 billion in 2004. Since the creation in the early 2000s of President Bush’s well-regarded signature programs—the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the President’s Malaria Initiative—foreign aid carries a Republican as well as a Democratic brand and has received congressional support from both parties.\n",
      "There was bipartisan rejection of proposals by the Trump administration to cut the U.S. international affairs budget by one-third, and, although in 2024 a small number of congressional opponents succeeded in delaying congressional consideration of supplemental foreign aid legislation, the bill passed the Congress with bipartisan support. On June 28, 2024, 80% of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives on a bipartisan vote rejected an amendment to eliminate foreign assistance from the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget.\n",
      "In sum\n",
      "A majority of the American people appear to understand that providing assistance to countries and people in need—whether for reasons of humanitarian relief, economic advancement, or security—advances the best interests of both the recipient country and America. We often disagree over the amount of support and to whom and how it should be provided, but collectively we understand that foreign assistance is an extension of American values and self-interest—our national interest in terms of our own and other countries’ security, economy, and humanitarian values.\n",

      "What are tariffs?\n",
      "Tariffs are taxes that countries impose on imported goods when they cross the border. From the founding of the United States until 1914, when the federal income tax was introduced, tariffs were the main source of revenue to the federal government. After World War II, the U.S. joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with 22 other countries, which aimed to promote international trade, and began decreasing tariffs. The downward trend in tariff rates continued until 2018, when the Trump administration raised tariffs on several products, especially those imported from China, igniting a trade war. Tariffs on China stopped increasing in January 2020 but have yet to decrease substantially, and remain well above their pre-2018 levels. The Biden administration has kept Trump-era tariffs on China in place and raised them on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells in May 2024. Unlike other taxes, which require the consent of Congress, legislation passed in 1934, 1962, and 1974 gives the executive branch leeway to lower tariff rates by up to 80% and to raise tariff rates if it serves a national security interest.\n",

      "Why do countries impose tariffs?\n",
      "Among the reasons that countries impose tariffs are to protect domestic industries (particularly those vital to national security), to incentivize foreign countries to change their practices, and to raise revenue. The Trump and Biden administrations said they imposed tariffs for the first two reasons.\n",
      "Even with the tariffs imposed during the Trump and Biden administrations, tariff revenues in fiscal year 2023 were slightly more than $80 billion, a small fraction of the $4.439 trillion in total U.S government revenues for that year. The global proliferation of free agreements since World War II has substantially lowered tariff rates, and in turn lowered tariff revenue in wealthy countries, though a number of developing countries still rely on tariffs for a substantial proportion of government revenues.\n",

      "What tariffs did the Trump administration raise and why?\n",
      "The Trump administration argued tariffs were “imposed to encourage China to change [its] unfair practices,” as they were “threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers.” This statement cited a report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative which found that China’s actions “pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities … deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain … and support unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies.” The administration argued in January 2018 that its initial round of tariffs on washing machines was necessary, as increasing imports had hurt American washing machine manufacturers’ financial performance. The tariffs, which made imports more expensive, were supposed to increase domestic purchases of washing machines. Trump’s U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also argued in July of that year that “China [had] been engaging in industrial policy which [had] resulted in the transfer and theft of intellectual property and technology to the detriment of our economy,” prompting punitive tariffs to spur a change in policy. Trump frequently cited China’s business practices as the cause of the trade deficit between the U.S. and China, saying in June 2018 that “the United States [is] at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in our massive $376 billion trade imbalance in goods.”\n",
      "China responded to the initial round with retaliatory tariffs. This prompted both countries to continue increasing tariffs for the better part of two years. The U.S.-China trade war paused in January 2020, when the U.S. agreed not to impose planned tariffs on China, and China agreed to buy more U.S. exports. By this point, the level of U.S. tariffs on China had increased from under 5% to over 20%.\n",
      "What did the Biden administration do with tariffs?\n",
      "The Biden administration has not reduced any of Trump’s tariffs on China, and in May 2024 raised tariffs on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.\n",
      "Biden’s May 2024 tariff increases follow much of the same logic as Trump’s initial 2018 tariffs, albeit without mention of the U.S. trade deficit with China. In its release, the administration argued that “American workers continue to face unfair competition from China’s non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum” and “encourage[d] China to eliminate its unfair trade practices.” The Biden administration, like the Trump administration, sees tariffs on China as both a punitive measure that might spur a change in Chinese industrial policy as well a way to protect domestic manufacturers.\n",
      "Though the Biden administration has drawn criticism from advocates of free trade in both parties for keeping protectionist trade policy, he also has important constituents who want to keep tariffs in place. At the start of his term, the U.S. steel industry, including its union workers, urged Biden to hold steady. In November 2023, Democratic senators Bob Casey Jr. and Sherrod Brown, both from Rust Belt states with many union workers, wrote a letter to Biden arguing that tariffs on steel and aluminum were still necessary.\n",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was asked at a June 2024 event at the Atlantic Council where she agrees and differs with Trump’s former USTR Robert Lighthizer. She said they agree the U.S. has to “change [its] approach to trade,” that she and Lighthizer “share a lot of the same diagnoses” on the U.S.-China trade relationship, and that “one of the ways where Bob and I are most different is in rhetoric.”   While many economists and some policymakers in the past have emphasized the benefits of trade to American consumers, Tai and Lighthizer emphasize the risks that trade poses to American workers. For more on Tai’s views, see this interview from Vox.com.  For more on Lighthizer’s commentary, see this site, or his 2023 book, “No Trade is Free.”\n",
      "Who bears the cost of tariffs?\n",
      "The burden of tariffs can fall on consumers (who may pay higher prices), on importers (who may absorb the cost by reducing their profits and not pass it along to consumers), on exporters (who may absorb the cost and accept lower net prices for their goods), or on some mix of those. Tariffs are often imposed on intermediate goods—goods that are used in the production of things that consumers buy—and this can both erode producers’ profits (unless they find domestic substitutes for those inputs) and the prices they charge consumers. Which party bears the heaviest burden depends on the specific market.\n",
      "A literature review by the Tax Foundation found that U.S. consumers and firms bore the brunt of costs in the recent trade war, with some studies finding partial pass-through (the price increases, but not by as much as the tariff, hurting both importers and consumers), others finding almost complete pass-through (the price increases by the amount of the tariff), and a couple of cases of over-shifting (the price increases by more than the amount of the tariff). They did not find substantial evidence that foreign exporters absorbed the economic burden of the tariffs by lowering prices.\n",
      "What impact do tariffs have on economic growth?\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says that the effect of tariffs on output can be ambiguous. On the one hand, some consumers end up buying domestic goods instead of imported goods, and tariff revenues make more resources available for private investment by decreasing the national deficit. These factors increase GDP. On the other, the purchasing power of consumers goes down as goods are more expensive, retaliatory tariffs decrease exports, and some businesses delay new investments out of caution. These factors all decrease GDP.\n",
      "On balance, economists tend to agree that free trade (low tariffs) increases economic growth more than protectionist trade policy (high tariffs). Free trade allows producers with comparative advantage to get their products to the market cheaply and efficiently, and tariffs get in the way. Additionally, while tariffs may protect infant industries, they can also reduce competition, with adverse effects on an economy. In the 20th century, many developing countries put large tariffs on imported goods using a strategy called “import substitution” to give a country’s domestic industries a leg up until they could compete with advanced countries. In practice, those industries often remained underdeveloped, as they never had to compete with better technology.\n",
      "Today’s advocates of tariffs say that the textbook models don’t resemble reality because China, in particular, heavily subsidizes key industries and gives them an advantage of over American producers—and could put them out of business altogether, giving China a monopoly.\n",
      "What have been the economic effects of recent tariff policy?\n",
      "In August 2019, CBO estimated that the negative GDP effects of recent tariff increases had outweighed the positive ones and were decreasing real output by 0.3%. The Tax Foundation estimated in July 2023 that the long-run effects would bring GDP down by 0.2% and total employment down by 142,000 jobs. Economists Mary Amiti of the New York Fed, Stephen Redding of Princeton, and David Weinstein of Columbia found, in a 2020 working paper, that “U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers.” Michael Pettis of the Carnegie Endowment noted that, even when the U.S.-China trade deficit decreases, as it did after the tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world increases by at least as much.\n",
      "Those worried about the threat that China poses to U.S. prosperity say the costs imposed by tariffs are worth the benefits. Total imports from China are down from pre-2018 trends as intended, and imports from China on products with high tariffs cratered in 2019 and 2020. While this shows signs of some economic decoupling, the effects have been partially offset by a surge in Chinese imports on products without tariffs.\n",
      "Where is U.S. tariff policy headed?\n",
      "If messaging from the Biden administration and Trump campaign is any signal, the era of high tariffs will continue past 2024, though the nature and scope of the tariffs will depend on who wins the November 2024 election. Biden’s May 2024 tariff increases affect $18 billion worth of goods, while some Trump proposals would impose tariffs on all U.S. imports from China (over $400 billion) or on all U.S. imports (slightly under $4 trillion). After Biden’s announcement of increased tariffs in May 2024, Trump said increased tariffs should also apply to vehicles “and a lot of other products.”\n",
      " Trump also has suggested a flat 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on imports from China. This would constitute a very large increase, with one analysis predicting that this would cost the typical household $1,700 annually.\n",
      "In June 2024, Trump floated fully replacing the income tax with tariffs, which would effectively shift the burden of paying for government from upper-income Americans (because the income tax is progressive) to those who don’t make enough income to pay much, if any, income taxes.\n",
      "Economists Kim Clausing and Maury Obstfeldt argue that replacing the income tax with tariffs is impossible:\n",
      "“Tariffs are levied on imported goods, which totaled $3.1 trillion in 2023. The income tax is levied on incomes, which exceed $20 trillion; the U.S. government raises about $2 trillion in individual and corporate income taxes at present. It is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump’s $2 trillion goal unattainable.”\n",
      "What are the specific sections of the law that empower the president to impose tariffs?\n",
      "(This is drawn from a summary prepared by the law firm of Skadden Arps and by the Congressional Research Service.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 232(b) allows the president, after an investigation by the Department of Commerce, to impose tariffs or quotas on imports that threaten U.S. national security.\n",
      "Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 authorizes the president to impose quotas and tariffs of as much as 15% for up to 150 days against countries that have “large and serious” balance-of-payment surpluses with the U.S. This provision has never been invoked.\n",
      "Trade Act of 1974, Section 201 allows the president to impose tariffs or quotas on imports of a particular product if the U.S. International Trade Commission finds there has been a surge of imports of that product that cause serious injury to the U.S. industry producing that product. For example, President Trump imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in January 2018 under Section 201.\n",
      "Trade Act of 1974, Section 301, authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to impose tariffs or quotas if it finds that another country has denied the United States its rights under a trade agreement or has engaged in practices that are unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. For instance, President Biden in May 2024 increased tariffs on Chinese steel, aluminum, semiconductors, and electric vehicles under Section 301. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) authorize the president to regulate all forms of international commerce and freeze assets in time of war (TWEA and IEEPA) or in response to “unusual or extraordinary” international threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States (IEEPA). President Trump threatened to invoke IEEPA in May 2019 to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico unless Mexico stemmed the flow of immigrants, but reached an agreement with Mexico before the tariffs were actually imposed.\n",

On January 18, Congress avoided a partial government shutdown by extending that deadline until March 1. Funding for agencies covered by the other eight appropriations bills, including Defense, had been slated to expire on February 2, 2024; the January 18 legislation extended that deadline to March 8. At the end of February, Congress extended the deadlines again—to March 8 for six appropriation bills, which finally passed Congress late in the day on March 8, funding those agencies through the end of the fiscal year in September 2024, and March 22 for the remaining six, including Defense and Homeland Security. In the early morning hours of March 23, the Senate passed and sent to the president those six appropriations bills.\n",
      "Why do government shutdowns happen?\n",
      "Under the Antideficiency Act (initially passed in 1884 and amended in 1950), federal agencies cannot spend or obligate any money without an appropriation (or other approval) from Congress. When Congress fails to enact the 12 annual appropriation bills, federal agencies must cease all non-essential functions until Congress acts. This is known as a government shutdown. If Congress enacts some but not all of the 12 appropriations bills, only agencies without appropriations have to shut down; this is known as a partial shutdown.\n",
      "What happens when that occurs?\n",
      "During shutdowns, many federal employees are told not to report for work, though under a 2019 law they get paid retroactively when the shutdown ends. Government employees who provide what are deemed essential services, such as air traffic control and law enforcement, continue to work, but don’t get paid until Congress takes action to end the shutdown. All this applies only to the roughly 25% of federal spending subject to annual appropriation by Congress.\n",
      "Benefits such as Social Security and Medicare continue to flow because they are authorized by Congress in laws that do not need annual approval (although the services offered by Social Security benefit offices may be limited during a shutdown). In addition, the Treasury can continue to pay interest on U.S. Treasury debt on time.\n",
      "Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans, or government benefits; shuttered visitor centers and bathrooms at national parks; fewer food-safety inspections; and various inconveniences. Shutdowns are sufficiently likely that the White House Office of Management & Budget posts detailed contingency plans that government agencies maintain for shutdowns, as well as a 51-page Q&A on shutdown procedures.\n",
      "The plans are often quite specific. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s contingency plan, for instance, cautions: “During the shutdown, employees who have not been designated as excepted may not volunteer to work without pay. Such voluntary services are a violation of the Antideficiency Act and will not be permitted under any circumstances.” The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation says, “A staff person will be instructed to ensure that, at the end of the last day of work with appropriated funds, lights and electronic devices not needed during the shutdown are turned off.” Some agencies say operations will continue if they haven’t spent previously appropriated sums or if they have income from fees that they can tap. The National Gallery of Art, for instance, says it will remain open as long as it can tap such reserves, but will have to close if the shutdown lingers. And the Centers for Disease Control says that 46% of its employees (or 6,448 individuals) will remain on the job, including 2,518 who are “exempt” because their activities or positions are funded outside of the usual annual appropriation process, and 3,930 who are “excepted” because their activities are deemed necessary by implication, or for the safety of human life or protection of property. \n",
      "What about the courts and Congress?\n",
      "In a 1981 opinion, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti said that the president could continue to exercise his constitutional responsibilities during a shutdown. With that logic, lawyers for the federal courts and Congress have said that judges and members of Congress – and those who support them in their essential duties – can stay on the job even if the appropriations bills that fund them lapse. But some judicial and congressional employees are furloughed. \n",
      " \n",
      "In a shutdown, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, federal courts continue to operate for a while by drawing on fees they have collected (as distinguished from appropriations) and by delaying new hires, non-case related travel, etc. If the shutdown is prolonged and those funds are spent, then the courts say they can continue work that supports their constitutional powers. \n",
      " \n",
      "As for Congress, the Congressional Research Service says, “Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, members of Congress are not subject to furlough.” Only those congressional staffers whose work is “required to support Congress with its constitutional responsibilities or those necessary to protect life and property” can remain on the job. But even those congressional staff don’t get paid during a shutdown, though they do get paid retroactively.  \n",
      "Why did a shutdown look likely in the fall of 2023?\n",
      "In June 2023, with the backing of Republican leaders in the House and Senate, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which lifted the ceiling on the federal debt and set limits on annual appropriated spending—one for defense, one for non-defense—for the fiscal years 2024 (which begins October 1, 2023) and 2025. At the time, the expectations were that this settled the overall size of the appropriations bills, and Congress would pass 12 bills that added up to the agreed-upon levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee has followed that path and has passed all 12 appropriations bills with bipartisan support. But House Republicans, unhappy with the agreement Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck with the White House, want to spend less than the levels specified in the Fiscal Responsibility Act—much to the consternation of Democrats and the White House, which says President Biden would veto the appropriations bills that are pending in the House. The House bills also include provisions on abortion, contraception, regulation of tobacco, and healthcare for trans persons that aren’t likely to pass the Senate.\n",
      "When the House and Senate pass different bills, the next step is a conference committee at which the two chambers are supposed to forge a compromise, which goes to a vote in each chamber before going to the president. That is likely to be very contentious.\n",
      "What is a continuing resolution?\n",
      "When Congress hasn’t passed appropriations bills for an entire fiscal year, it sometimes passes temporary spending bills—continuing resolutions—that fund government operations until a specified date. Continuing resolutions often, although not always, continue the level of funding at the prior year’s appropriations level. According to the Government Accountability Office, there were 47 continuing resolutions (often known as “CRs” inside the Beltway) between fiscal years 2010 and 2022. They ranged from one day to just under six months. Although they keep the government operating, the GAO said they can be difficult for government agencies to manage, because they often have to plan for a government shutdown because they can’t be sure a CR will pass, they can disrupt agency hiring plans, and they make planning difficult.\n",
      "The Fiscal Responsibility Act has an unusual feature that was intended to discourage Congress from funding the government with a continuing resolution beyond the end of December 2023. It didn’t have the intended effect. The law said that if a CR were in effect on January 1, 2024 (and that was the case), then limits on spending would be automatically revised downward from the levels set in the law. But the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a December 2023 memo that the law delays any action to restrain spending to comply with those lower limits until April 30. If Congress enacts full-year appropriations before April 30, it would likely waive those lower spending limits before they take effect.\n",
      "How common are government shutdowns?\n",
      "There have been four shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. In 1995-1996, President Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels; the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. In 2013, a standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day shutdown. And in December 2018 and January 2019, a dispute over border wall funding led to a shutdown that lasted 35 days; it was a partial shutdown because Congress had previously passed five of the 12 appropriation bills.\n",
      "What impact do government shutdowns have on the overall economy?\n",
      "A shutdown of a few days is a hassle—and undermines public confidence in the capacity of U.S. politicians to do the people’s business—but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy. A prolonged shutdown, however, can cause bigger problems, albeit most temporary. Goldman Sachs estimates that a shutdown would reduce GDP growth by about 0.2 percentage point each week it lasts, and that growth would rise by the same amount in the quarter following the shutdown’s end.\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the five-week partial shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019—partial because five of the 12 appropriation bills had been passed—reduced the level of GDP growth by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($3 billion in 2019 dollars) and by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019 ($8 billion), mainly from the loss of furloughed federal workers’ pay and the delay in federal spending on goods and services. “Although most of the real GDP lost…will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3 billion will not be,” CBO said. In other words, the GDP in 2019 was estimated to be 0.02% lower because of the shutdown than it otherwise would have been. The CBO estimates did not account for such indirect effects as the inability of some businesses to obtain federal permits or apply for federal loans.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a famous conversation, the author F. Scott Fitzgerald is credited with saying that “the rich are very different than you and me,” to which Ernest Hemingway replied “Yes, they have more money.”\n",
      "Our work highlights another key difference: the most affluent Americans not only have more income; they receive it—and pay taxes on it—in vastly different ways than the rest of us.\n",
      "For policy makers concerned about long-term fiscal shortfalls and high levels of economic inequality, our work reinforces the notion that raising the tax burden on the wealthy requires a special focus on how those households gain wealth and skirt taxes. We highlight four ways to effectively raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n",
      "How Americans make money\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Americans receive almost all their income through wages and retirement income (pensions, 401(k)s, social security, and individual retirement accounts). The most recent available IRS data (2014) shows that wages and retirement income made up 94% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution. Even for households in the 98th to 99th income percentile, wages and retirement income accounted for 71% of AGI.\n",
      "At the very, very top, though, these sources are less important, accounting for just 15% and 7% of the income of the top 0.01% and the top 0.001% of households, respectively. These households  receive most of their income from investments (interest, dividends, and especially realized capital gains) and businesses (including sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations). These items constituted 82% of income for the top 0.01% and 88% for the top 0.001%, compared to just 7% for the bottom 80% of households.\n",
      "These patterns are robust over time and data sources. And in practice, the tilt toward capital income at the top is even larger than these figures suggest because AGI does not include the massive unrealized capital gains and very sizable inheritances that accrue to many affluent households.\n",

      "How that money gets taxed\n",
      "Wages face heavier taxation than capital income, even though wages go mainly to low- and middle-income households and capital income goes mainly to high-income households. Most federal revenues are collected from wages. Payroll taxes account for 33% of federal revenues and are imposed solely on wages. Income taxes account for another 52% of federal revenues, and studies show that the share of income tax revenues that derive from capital income is quite small. These studies were performed before the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which further diminished the taxation of capital via special deductions for business and cuts in the top income tax rate, the corporate tax rate, and the estate tax.\n",
      "Moreover, the highest effective marginal income tax rates on wages exceed 40%, whereas much business income is taxed at a top rate below 30%, dividends and realized capital gains are taxed below 25%, and unrealized gains are not taxed until they are sold. As a result, the tax share of income paid by the very highest-income households is often lower than for middle-class households.\n",
      "How to fix it\n",
      "There are many ways to raise taxes on the wealthy without  harming economic growth.  Here we highlight four options.\n",
      "Capital gains reform may be necessary if policymakers want to increase tax burdens on wealthy households. The simplest policy here would be the elimination of the step-up basis at death. Heirs would pay capital gains taxes on the taxable basis of the decedent who acquired the asset, instead of the basis of the asset at death. In 2020, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) staff calculated that terminating step-up that year would raise $104.9 billion over the next 10 years. Alternatively, capital gains could be taxed at death, and treated as though the decedent had sold that asset. Batchelder and Kamin (2019) used 2016 JCT predictions to estimate that taxing accrued gains at death and raising the capital gains rate to 28% would raise $290 billion between 2021 and 2030.\n",
      "Taxing intergenerational wealth transfers can make taxes more progressive and offset disparities in opportunity across income classes. Currently, less than 0.1% of all estates are subject to the estate tax, down from 7.65% in 1977.  As baby boomers die, they are set to pass down $72.6 trillion in assets to heirs. Taxing these transfers more heavily would reduce inequality, increase opportunity, and raise revenues.  The estate tax could be converted to an inheritance tax on recipients, with a reduced threshold of a million dollars for all gifts and inheritances (compared to the current threshold of almost $13 million) coupled with a tax rate that would equal the heir’s income tax rate plus some amount. This combined tax rate would integrate income and estate taxes. Since the heirs to wealthy estates are already usually in high tax brackets, the distributional impact would be similar to (though slightly less progressive than) the estate tax. This change has the political advantage of focusing on wealthy heirs, who were lucky enough to be the beneficiaries of wealthy relatives or friends, instead of targeting those who accumulated wealth.\n",
      "Eliminating the Section 199A deduction for qualified business incomes would target another key component of income for the wealthy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, and the deduction brought the effective rate on qualified business income down to 29.6%. In 2020, the Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated that the deduction would lower federal revenues by $417 billion over the following 10 years. The deduction is inequitable: the TPC estimated that 55% of the direct tax benefits in 2019 would go to families in the top 1% of the income distribution and 26% of the benefits would go to the top 0.1%. Although the deduction was intended to increase employment and investment, the incentives for both are actually quite low given the complicated structure and non-targeted nature of the deduction.  Additionally, its complexity creates an opening for business owners to reduce their taxes by re-arranging and relabeling their investments and expenses, a practice which is further incentivized  by the increased difference between the effective tax rates on wages and business income.\n",
      "A final option would be to create a value added tax (VAT) coupled with a rebate or Universal Basic Income (UBI). This would leave the net tax burden smaller or unchanged for most households but would impose higher tax burdens on the wealthy. Currently, wealthy households can finance extravagant levels of consumption without even paying capital gains taxes on the accruing wealth by following a “buy, borrow, die” strategy, in which they finance current spending with loans and use their wealth as collateral. By avoiding realizing their capital gains, they can avoid taxes at the same time they enjoy a luxurious lifestyle. A VAT would tax consumption and hence would force the affluent to pay taxes on their lifestyle, even if they did not pay much in income tax. A VAT of 10%, combined with a UBI payment of the federal poverty line times the VAT rate times two, would raise about $2.9 trillion over 10 years. The Tax Policy Center estimates that this system  would be extremely progressive: after-tax income for the lowest quintile would increase by 17%, the tax burden for middle-income people wouldn’t change, and incomes for the top 1% of households would be reduced by 5.5%. The VAT would also function as a 10% tax on existing wealth, since future consumption can only be financed with existing wealth or future wages.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Each of these proposals would undoubtedly face significant opposition from those who benefit from the challenge of taxing affluent households: the wealthy themselves. However, in order to face the dual concerns of ever-increasing national debt and rapidly growing inequality, it is a challenge that we must take on before it’s too late.\n",
